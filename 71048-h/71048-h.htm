<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>The prominent position assumed by women
during the eighteenth century has always
been considered a characteristic trait of that
period. We do not here refer to the intrigues
or friendships of the younger women.
We allude rather to the influence of women
of a certain age, who, as mothers and advisers,
formed so powerful an element in
society.</p>

<p>The Vicomte de Ségur, in his book upon
women, gives us a vivid description of the
manner in which this feminine influence
made itself felt: “Society,” he says, “was
at that time divided into three classes: the
young women, women of a certain age, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
those elderly ladies who, receiving every consideration
and respect, were regarded as the
upholders of established principles, and, in a
great measure, the sole arbitrators of taste,
tone, and fashion. A young man coming
out in society was said to make his ‘debût’
or ‘first appearance.’ He was bound to
succeed or fail; that is to say, he had to
please or displease these three classes of
women, whose sentence determined his reputation,
his position at Court, his place and
rank, and who nearly always made up an
excellent match for him.”</p>

<p>All education, therefore, tended towards
the attainment of this favourable object.
The father merely directed a tutor to give
his son such general and superficial instruction
as might inspire the child with a possible
taste for some branch of learning later on.
But the mother alone imparted to her son
that polish, grace, and amiability which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
herself possessed, and to which she knew so
much importance was attached. Her self-love
and her maternal affection were equally
involved. “If a young man,” M. de Ségur
again writes, “had been wanting in proper
attention towards a lady, or a man older than
himself, his mother was sure to be informed
of it by her friends the same evening, and the
next day the giddy young fellow was certain to
be reprimanded!” From this system arose
that delicate politeness, that exquisite good
taste and moderation in speech, whether
discussing or jesting, which constituted the
manners of what was termed “Good Society”
(<i>La bonne compagnie</i>).</p>

<p>The first question we naturally ask ourselves
is: What was the training that so
well prepared young girls, when married, to
take such a leading part in society? Where
had they learnt that consummate art of good
taste and tone, that facility of conversation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
which enabled them to glance at the lightest
subjects, or discuss the most serious topics,
with an ease and grace of which Mesdames
de Luxembourg, de Boufflers, de Sabran,
the Duchesse de Choiseul, the Princesse de
Beauvau, the Comtesse de Ségur, and many
others, give us such perfect examples? This
question is the more difficult to solve from
the fact that, although the mothers were
much occupied with the education of their
sons, we do not find that they concerned
themselves in the same degree with that of
their daughters. The reason is very simple.
At this epoch young girls, especially those
of the nobility, were never brought up at
home, but were sent to a Convent at five
or six years of age. They only left it to
marry, and the mother’s influence was entirely
absent, or came but late into play. What
was, therefore, the conventual education
which produced such brilliant results? We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
believe we have found an interesting answer
to this question in the <i>Memoirs</i> of the young
Princesse Massalska, which are contained in
the first part of this work. They show us,
without reserve, the strong and the weak
points of the training given to girls of good
family, future great ladies,—a training which
enabled them to play their part on a stage
where success awaited them, but whose brilliant
scene was so soon to disappear in the storm that
was already threatening the political horizon.</p>

<p>It is evident, however, that although this
system fulfilled its purpose, it could not entirely
replace home education. But where did
family life exist in the eighteenth century?
Perhaps in the middle classes; but even that
is not certain—for they strove to imitate the
upper classes; and under the conditions which
prevailed at that time amongst the nobility,
family life, such as we understand it, was an
impossibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span></p>

<p>All gentlemen of good name held an
office at Court, or a rank in the army, and
consequently lived very little at home. A
great many of the female members of the
family were attached to the service of the
Queen or the Princesses by duties which required
their presence at Versailles, and took
up half their time. The other half was
employed either in paying their court, or in
cultivating those accomplishments which
were considered so important. They had
also to read up the new books, about which
they would have to converse in the evening;
and as dressing, especially hair-dressing,
took up most of the morning, they generally
employed in reading the time which
the hairdresser devoted to the construction
of those wonderful edifices which ladies then
carried about on their heads.</p>

<p>All the great houses received daily twenty
to twenty-five people to dinner, and the conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
was hardly of a nature to admit of
the presence of young girls. The dinner
hour was at one o’clock, they separated at
three, and at five went to the theatre, whenever
their duties did not summon them to
Versailles; after which they returned home,
bringing with them as many friends as possible.
What time could have been devoted to
the children in a day so fully occupied? The
mothers felt this, and by placing their daughters
in a convent did the best they could for
them. But we shall see, by the life of the
young Princess herself, how incomplete was
an education thus carried on by women, themselves
utterly ignorant of the world, and
therefore unfit to prepare their pupils for the
temptations that there awaited them.</p>

<p>These <i>Memoirs</i>, begun by a child of nine
years old and continued till she was fourteen,
commence with her entry into the Convent
and end on the eve of her marriage. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
were not intended to be published, and have
lain by for over a hundred years in their old
cases, from whence, with M. Adolphe Gaiffe’s
kind permission, we brought them to light,
when searching through his splendid libraries
at the Château d’Oron and in Paris. There,
amongst treasures of the sixteenth century
and austere Huguenot authors bound in
black shagreen, or dark turkey leather, we
found the journals of the little Princesse
Massalska, whose bright blue, yellow, and
red covers contrasted with those of their
sterner neighbours.</p>

<p>Their genuineness is unquestionable. The
margins covered with childish caricatures, and
scribbled over with her or her companions’ jokes,
like any schoolboy’s book; the old
yellow-stained paper, the faded ink, the large
handwriting, which gradually improves; the
incorrect and careless style of the first
chapters, which towards the end becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
remarkable for its elegance;—all combine to
show us that these <i>Memoirs</i> are really the production
of a precocious and intelligent child.</p>

<p>The Princess died forty years after
having written them, and she only mentions
them twice in her correspondence. She
simply says that one day at Bel Œil, the
residence of the Prince de Ligne, her father-in-law,
she read some passages of the
<i>Memoirs</i> she wrote when she was a little girl,
and that her husband was so amused by them
that he wanted to print a couple of chapters
in his private printing-press. Twenty years
later, during a long winter in Poland, she
read them to her daughter, the Princesse
Sidonie, and was much pleased at finding
her childish recollections so ingeniously expressed.</p>

<p>Our researches have enabled us to test
the veracity of these <i>Memoirs</i>. We found
by the records at Geneva how exact is her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
account of Mademoiselle de Montmorency’s
death; and the romantic story of Madame
de Choiseul Stainville, as related in the
<i>Mémoires</i> of Lauzun, in the <i>Correspondance</i>
of Madame du Deffand, and in the <i>Mémoires</i>
of Durfort de Cheverny, confirms and explains
the narrative of the little Princess,
written forty or fifty years before these
<i>Memoirs</i> were published. She also describes
a taking of the veil, of which we have found
an official report in the national Archives.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
After the names of the Abbess and Prioress
and other signatures, appears that of the
little Princess as one of the witnesses.</p>

<p>Convinced of the exactness of the facts
related by Hélène Massalska, it has seemed
to us interesting to place before the public
this faithful picture of an education in the
eighteenth century, with its detailed account of
the studies, punishments, rewards, and games<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</span>
of the Convent, and its descriptions, often
satirical, but always witty, of the mistresses
and scholars; in fact, the complete life of a
young girl in a Convent from 1772 to 1779.
We must add that all worldly gossip did not
stop at the Convent door, that many echoes
invaded the cloisters, and that the little
Princess does not fail to notice them. This
is not the least curious side of the book.</p>

<p>After reading these interesting pages, we
felt regret at parting so abruptly with the
little writer; and we have, thanks to the
kindness of our friends and correspondents,
been able to reconstruct the history of her
life.</p>

<p>The Princesse Massalska, later on
Princesse de Ligne, though she did not play
a prominent part in history, found herself,
through her uncle, the Bishop of Wilna, and
her father-in-law and husband, the Princes
de Ligne, mixed up with many interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</span>
historical events. Besides which, her own life
was a most romantic one. The variety of
documents we have gathered together, and the
brevity of many of the memoranda, have not
permitted us to quote them word for word,
as we have done in the case of the letters.
We have therefore endeavoured to give
them a certain unity of style, and to avoid
such sudden transitions as might be distasteful
to our readers.</p>

<p>On a dull December day, in the year of grace
1771, a coach drew up at the door of the Convent
of the Abbaye-aux-Bois, Rue de Sève,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and three persons alighted from it—a lady
advanced in years, very simply dressed; a
man of distinguished appearance, easily recognisable
as a foreigner; and a pale and
delicate-looking little girl. These persons
were no other than the famous Madame
Geoffrin; Prince Massalski, Bishop of Wilna;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
and his eight years old niece, the little
Princesse Hélène.</p>

<p>The Prince-Bishop, implicated in the late
Polish revolution, had barely escaped arrest
by flight. He was bringing to Paris his
niece and his nephew, orphans who had been
placed under his guardianship. It will here
be necessary to cast a retrospective glance at
the series of events which brought this exiled
family to Paris.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Wilna was a son of Prince
Massalski, Grand General of Lithuania. He
attained to the episcopate<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> at an early age,
and became possessed of considerable influence.
His contemporaries describe him as a
learned scholar, erudite, and gifted with a
quick and lively intelligence, but at the same
time add that he was frivolous and fickle.
To excessive timidity he united a disposition
prone to meddle with eagerness in every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
concern. Hasty in his schemes and irresolute
afterwards in their execution, his conduct was
often at variance with the principles he professed.</p>

<p>The Bishop was a gambler: he lost in three
years more than a hundred thousand ducats,
and in spite of the immense territorial possessions
of the Massalski was continually in
monetary difficulties.</p>

<p>His family was one of the most influential
in Lithuania, where two rival houses—the
Radziwill and the Massalski—contended
for supremacy. The latter supported
the Czartoryski faction, assisting them by
every means in their power to obtain, with
Russia’s concurrence, the Polish throne for
their nephew, Stanislaus-Augustus. The
Radziwill, on the other hand, sworn enemies
of the Czartoryski, upheld the ancient
traditions of the Polish Republic, proving
themselves more than hostile to Russian
influence and to the nomination of Stanislaus-Augustus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>The Polish feudal lords exercised in
their respective provinces the authority of
sovereigns;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> their chamberlains, masters of
hounds, and equerries could compare with
Crown officials. They possessed body-guards
of dragoons, cossacks, and infantry, and often
a considerable militia, of which the officers
equalled in rank those of the royal forces.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that the nobles, although
weakened by formidable factions, could dispose
of a power with which the king had
to reckon. They enjoyed all feudal privileges,
and, heedless of the authority of the Crown,
were unwilling to yield up any of their
prerogatives, each one being determined to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
exercise solely that authority in his own
palatinate or <i>woivodie</i>, the result being that
the lesser <i>diètes</i>, called Dietines,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which preceded
the election of a king or of a grand
<i>diète</i>, usually ended in a sanguinary conflict.
At the critical moment, when the Dietines
met for the election of Stanislaus-Augustus,
the Massalski most opportunely distributed
large sums of money; sent their troops to
surround the Dietines, of which they felt least
assured, and, thanks to these extremely efficacious
electoral proceedings, none of the
members proposed by the Radziwill were
nominated. On hearing this result, Prince
Radziwill hurriedly left his castle, or rather
fortress, and hastened to Wilna, escorted by
the two hundred noblemen who formed his
usual retinue, and who were the terror of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
country. He broke into the episcopal palace,
drove out the judges appointed by the
Dietines and, violently apostrophising the
prelate, he ran over rapidly the names of the
former bishops whom the princes had put to
death for interfering in public affairs, ending
with these words: “Next time you are subjected
to the same temptation, remember
that I have a hundred thousand ducats in
reserve with which to obtain my absolution
at Rome.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The Bishop was at first dismayed by
Radziwill’s insolent threats, and allowed him
to depart without opposition, but, suddenly
recovering his presence of mind, he sounded
the alarm bell, armed the people, recalled the
judges, barricaded the episcopal palace and
cathedral, and drove Radziwill out of Wilna.
This incident affords a striking illustration of
the violence commonly perpetrated in Poland
at that time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>
<p>The Prince-Bishop having so warmly
supported the election of Stanislaus-Augustus,
it was natural to expect that he would continue
to uphold the authority of the King.
Such, however, was not the case.</p>

<p>The treaty of peace signed at Warsaw in
1768 between Russia and Poland had given
great offence to the heads of the Catholic
clergy, for it granted to the Polish dissidents,
to the Greek community, to the Lutherans
and Calvinists, the same rights which had till
then been the exclusive privilege of the
Roman Catholic Church.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Most of the
bishops refused to submit to these new terms.
The share which Polish dissidents might now
claim in public affairs, the appointments to
which they might now aspire, combined to
exasperate the nobility. Armed confederations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
were organised on all sides, and entered into
conflict with the Court party, and with the
Russians, whose troops, under pretext of
upholding the King’s authority, occupied in
Poland numerous forts, and perpetrated inconceivable
outrages. Bishop Massalski was
one of the principal promoters of the most
famous of these associations—that of the Confederation
of Bar. His father, the Grand
General of Lithuania, had just died, and
Count Oginski had succeeded him in that
important command. The Bishop found no
difficulty in gaining him over to the new
confederation.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>On the 20th of September, Oginski
had already attacked and defeated the
Russians, captured half a regiment and
massacred the other half, but shortly after
fortune deserted his cause. Overcome by
numbers, and, it is said, by treachery, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
fled with difficulty to Königsberg amidst a
thousand dangers.</p>

<p>His defeat was the signal for the disbanding
of the confederates. The Prince-Bishop had
left Warsaw for Wilna early in June to assist
Oginski with his powerful influence, but
hearing of the victory of the Russians and
their advance on Wilna, he secretly left in
great haste for France, taking with him his
nephew, Prince Xavier, and his niece, the little
Princesse Hélène, who had been confided to
his care. The two children, careless of events,
allowed themselves to be hurried away by
their uncle, only too happy to leave a country
where they saw nothing but fierce-looking
soldiers, “whose appearance alone frightened
them.”</p>

<p>The Prince had no sooner crossed the
Polish frontier than he might have seen the
following in the Dutch Gazettes: “Major
Soltikoff, at the head of the Russian troops,
occupies Wilna, and has sequestrated all the
episcopal possessions; the household goods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
forming part of these possessions have been
at once removed and taken to the <i>résidence</i>.
As for the Bishop’s personal and family
property, it will be judicially seized by the
<i>castellan</i><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> of Novgorod, and be subject to his
administration.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The Bishop’s first care on arriving in
Paris was to call on Madame Geoffrin, whom
he had seen during her recent stay in Poland.
He was aware of her influence with the King,
and hoped to obtain by this means his recall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
from exile as well as the removal of the
decree sequestrating his property. Madame
Geoffrin, notwithstanding her usual discretion
and dread of being implicated in the affairs of
others, took the Bishop under her protection,
and wrote to the King as follows:<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<i>17th November 1771.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“The Bishop of Wilna is in Paris, where
he intends making some stay. He has
brought me two children, his niece and his
nephew, and has begged me to take them
under my care. I have placed the girl in a
convent, and sent the boy to college.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is apparent that Madame Geoffrin,
according to her usual discretion, does not
compromise herself in this first reference to
the Bishop; she merely acquaints the King
with the fact that she has seen the Bishop,
and then waits to know how he will receive
the information. The King appears to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
shown no displeasure, for she writes again, and
this time more boldly:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<i>13th January 1772.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“I implore your Majesty to write a few
words of kindness to the unfortunate Bishop
of Wilna; he is a child, but a foolish child,
devoted to your person. I can assure you
that he cannot be reproached with a single
step he has taken since his arrival in Paris.
He is the only Pole I receive, and he fears
me like fire; truly I have forbidden his talking
about Polish affairs with any of his countrymen,
and I feel certain of his obedience. He
has two servants I have procured for him.
The Abbé Bandeau and Colonel Saint Leu
form part of his household.”</p>
</div>

<p>It was not only in order to receive a few
words of kindly notice from the King that
the Bishop made use of Madame Geoffrin’s
influence. The chief object in view was to
obtain the removal of the decree of sequestration
under which his lands had been placed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
The King understood the case, but was unfavourably
disposed towards the Prince,
whose fidelity he doubted. Nevertheless he
wrote to Madame Geoffrin: “My last letter
to you enclosed one for the Bishop of Wilna,
written in accordance with the request contained
in your letter of 13th January. To
what I then wrote both to you and to him, I
can only here now add that I see by a letter
of his to the Abbé Siestrzencewiez he is
under the impression that I requested the
Russians to sequestrate his property.
Nothing is more untrue; neither his estates
nor those of any other persons have been
seized at my command. On the contrary, I
gave myself considerable trouble in order to
protect them. But, once for all, remember
the fable of the horse that was jealous of the
stag without knowing why. How, in order
to subdue him, he appealed to man, lent him
his back, and accepted the bridle. When,
thus combined, they had overcome the stag,
the horse tried to shake off his rider. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
latter, however, kept his seat, and vigorously
spurring him, compelled the animal to submit
to his mastery. The simile is apparent.
The Poles often feel the spur of the Russian
horseman, whose assistance they have invoked
against their king or against one of
their equals.</p>

<p>“The Bishop of Wilna is perfectly aware
against whom he wished the Russians to
intrigue. He has been punished according
to his deserts; but again I repeat, it is not I
who have drawn down upon him this punishment.
On the contrary, I have striven to
lighten it, by obtaining that part of his
revenues should be left him, and the fact
that my ministers, two of whom are my near
relatives, have for a year past had their lands
sequestered, is the best proof that I do not
command these Russian executions. However,
you may again assure the Bishop from
me that the moment I see an opportunity of
assisting him I will do so.”</p>

<p>The Prince-Bishop appeared satisfied with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
the King’s promise, and, expressing his extreme
gratitude to Madame Geoffrin, settled
in Paris as though he intended making it his
permanent abode. He then proceeded to
place his nephew and niece in the best educational
establishments it was possible to find.
We have already seen that he chose the
Abbaye-aux-Bois for the young Princess.</p>

<p>Two convents competed at that time for
the privilege of educating the daughters of
the nobility, Penthemont and the Abbaye-aux-Bois.
St. Cyr was no longer the fashion, and,
moreover, founded by Madame de Maintenon
for the gratuitous education of noble but
poor girls, it was restricted to a very limited
sphere. The two convents we have just
mentioned were, on the contrary, intended
only for the education of the daughters of the
richest and highest families.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The Abbaye-aux-Bois had been founded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
Jean de Nesle and his wife Anne d’Entragues,
in the diocese of Noyon, under the reign of
Louis le Gros, and belonged to the order of
Cîteaux.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In the year 1654 the Abbess and
nuns of the Abbaye-aux-Bois had been reduced
to flight in consequence of the disturbances
and devastations that had laid waste the
county of Soissonnais. They found shelter
in Paris, and there bought the convent of
<i>Dix Vertus</i>, situated in the Rue de Sève,
which had just been vacated by the nuns of
the order of the Annunciation of Bourges.</p>

<p>The Cistercian nuns<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> obtained from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
Pope the transfer of the deeds and possessions
of the Abbaye-aux-Bois, which the King ratified
by letters-patent, August 1667. On the
8th June 1718, Madame, widow of Philip of
France, brother of Louis XIV., laid the first
stone of the Church of Notre-Dame-aux-Bois,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
little anticipating that at a later period her own
grand-daughter, Louise-Adelaide d’Orleans,
would become Abbess of that same convent.</p>

<p>At the time of which we write the Abbaye-aux-Bois
was ruled by Madame Marie Madeleine
de Chabrillan, who had succeeded
Madame de Richelieu, sister of the famous
Maréchal. All the ladies entrusted with the
education of the scholars belonged to the
highest nobility; the pupils themselves bore
the noblest names in the kingdom, and,
strangely enough, their education combined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
the most practical and homely domestic duties,
with instructions best suited to mould them
for polished and courtly society.</p>

<p>Music, dancing, and painting were taught
with the greatest care. The Abbey possessed
a fine theatre well provided with scenery and
costumes, which, in point of elegance, left
nothing to be desired.</p>

<p>Moli and Larive taught elocution and the
art of reading aloud, the ballets were directed
by Noverre, Philippe, and Dauberval,
first dancers at the opera. The professors
were all chosen beyond the precincts of the
Abbey, the instructors in botany and natural
history alone being an exception to this rule.
The ladies merely superintended the studies
of their scholars, and were present during the
lessons.</p>

<p>They, however, took a much more active
share in the domestic education imparted to
the young girls after their <i>first communion</i>.</p>

<p>This we shall see later on.</p>

the same period Comte Potocki, Palatine of Kiowie, was obliged to
disband the 25,000 soldiers who had been kept on war footing for
a considerable time past by his family. Prince Radziwill (uncle of
the little Princesse Hélène) had a revenue of ten millions, and

Bishop of Wilna, and his father the Grand General of Lithuania.
With it began the civil wars of Poland. Louis XV. and the Sultan
secretly supported the Polish patriots, but the downfall of the Duc
de Choiseul and the defeat of the Turks led to the dispersion of the
confederates. The Confederation was reorganised in 1771.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> The Polish <i>castellans</i>, more especially in Lithuania, were
originally invested with the supervision of the castles, from a
military as well as from a judicial point of view. Subsequently
they only retained their judicial functions, and they formed part of
the Senate. They were divided into two classes, of which thirty-three
were superior <i>castellans</i> and forty-nine inferior <i>castellans</i>.

Russians. It would almost appear as if his ancestors had foreseen
the misfortunes which might befall their descendants, for they had
placed in their church at Diewick statues of solid gold, each a foot
and a half in height, representing the twelve apostles. When the
war broke out Prince Charles had the twelve apostles conveyed to
Munich, and by melting them down was able not only to live there

Saint Robert. The rules of Cîteaux were drawn up in 1107.
The Abbeys of La Ferté, of Pontigny, of Clairvaux, and of

Saint Hourbelle, mother of Saint Bernard, and several other ladies

virtue and austerity. But they did not long retain the favour of
their early piety. They acquired great wealth and, as the annals

<p>“I was received on a Thursday at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
Abbaye-aux-Bois. Madame Geoffrin, my
uncle’s friend, took me first to the Abbess’s
parlour, which is very handsome, for it is
painted white with gold stripes. Madame de
Rochechouart came to the parlour also, and
also Mother Quatre Temps, for she is the
head-mistress of the youngest class, to which
I am to belong.</p>

<p>“They were kind enough to say I had a
pretty face and a good figure and beautiful
hair. I made no reply, having quite forgotten
my French on the way, for I had been such
a long journey that I had passed through I
do not know how many towns, and always by
coach, the driver blowing his horn all the
time. I understood, however, all that was
said. They then told me they were going to
take me away to put on the scholar’s dress,
and that then they would bring me back to
the grating for Madame Geoffrin to see me.
They therefore opened the wicket of the
parlour grating and passed me through it, as
I was so small. They brought me to a room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
belonging to the Lady Abbess, all hung in blue
and white damask, and sister Crinore put
me on the dress, but when I saw that it was
black I cried so very hard, it was quite
piteous to see me; but when they added the
blue ribbons I was a little comforted, and then
the head-mistress brought some preserves
which I ate, and I was told we should be
given some every day. I was petted a good
deal, and the elder of the young ladies on
service at the <i>abbatial</i><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> came to look at me,
and I heard them say: ‘Poor little child, she
does not speak French; we must make her
speak Polish, to see what kind of a language
it is.’ But I, knowing they would laugh at
me, did not choose to speak. They said I
was very delicate, and then said that I came
from a very distant country, from Poland,
adding: ‘Ah, how comical to be a Pole!’</p>

<p>“However, Mademoiselle de Montmorency
took me on her knee and asked if she should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
be my little mother, and I answered by a nod,
for I was quite determined only to speak
when I could speak like everybody else. I
was asked if I thought the young lady holding
me pretty, so I put my hand to my eyes to
show that I thought hers were beautiful, and
then they amused themselves in trying to
make me say her name—‘Montmorency.’</p>

<p>“However, I was told that my uncle had
come to the parlour and wished to see me in
uniform. I therefore went, dressed as I was,
and it was thought that it suited me very
well, and after having well recommended me
to the ladies, my uncle and Madame Geoffrin
left. Then the Lady Abbess and Madame de
Rochechouart tried to make me converse, but
found it quite impossible, so that Madame de
Rochechouart called to Mademoiselle de
Montmorency and said: ‘Dear heart, I
recommend this child to your care; she is a
little foreigner, knowing hardly any French;
you have a kind heart, take her to the school,
and see that she is not teased; it will be easy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
for you to have her well received.’ But when
it came to giving my name Madame de
Rochechouart never could remember it; I
repeated it, but seeing that it was thought
ridiculous I proposed it should not in future
be mentioned; then Madame de Rochechouart
asked me if I had not a Christian name. I
said ‘Hélène;’ so Mademoiselle de Montmorency
said she would introduce me under
the name of Hélène.</p>

<p>“We started off. It was the recreation
time. Mademoiselle de Narbonne, who had
seen me at the <i>abbatial</i>, had already announced
me. She had said I was a ‘little
wild thing, who had not chosen to open her
lips; but that I was very graceful.’ As it was
raining that day the recreation was taking
place in All Souls’ cloisters. As soon as I
arrived they all came towards us. Mademoiselle
de Montmorency brought me to the
teachers, who made a great deal of me, and
the class surrounded me, asking all sorts of
queer questions, to which I did not reply,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
so that some of them thought I was
dumb.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Montmorency asked the
head-mistress of the blue class to be allowed
to show me over all the departments in the
Convent. Mother Quatre Temps consented.
Then she took me through the whole house,
and gave me a good collation. All the nuns
and scholars of the red class petted me
extremely. They gave me pin-cushions,
<i>soufflets</i>,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> <i>grimaces</i>,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and I was very
happy.</p>

<p>“At supper-time Mademoiselle de Montmorency
brought me back to the classroom,
and Mother Quatre Temps led me by the
hand to the refectory. I was given a seat
next to Mademoiselle de Choiseul, who was
the last arrival. During supper Mademoiselle
de Choiseul talked to me, and I risked a few
words in answer, so that she called out:
‘The little Pole speaks French.’ After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
supper I became quite intimate with Mademoiselle
de Choiseul, who was very pretty.
She told me that, when in the evening our
names were called over, I must ask Madame
de Rochechouart for a holiday, and give a
collation, and that she would do the speaking.
Then we played at many games—the massacre
of the innocents, and a thousand other things.
When it was bed-time we went to the nuns’
dormitory. Madame de Rochechouart read
the roll-call; I was called last. I came
forward with Mademoiselle de Choiseul, who
in my name begged for a holiday. Madame
de Rochechouart inquired from Mother Quatre
Temps if my uncle had been informed of
what was necessary to pay for ‘the welcome,’
as it was called, for it cost twenty-five <i>louis</i><a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
to give a grand collation to all the pupils,
and ices were absolutely necessary. Mother
Quatre Temps said Yes; so the following
Saturday was chosen for the holiday.”</p>

<p>It is easy to see by this opening scene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
that the little Pole would soon get accustomed
to her new life.</p>

<p>The blue class into which Hélène was
entered was composed of children from seven
to ten years old.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> It is interesting to note,
from the very first, what was the order of the
lessons, the working and recreation hours.
Hélène gives it in her own writing:
“Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: to
get up in summer at seven o’clock, in winter
at half-past seven. To be at eight in the
stalls of the schoolroom, ready for Madame
de Rochechouart, who comes in at eight.
Directly she has left, to learn the <i>Catéchisme
de Montpellier</i>,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and repeat it. At nine
o’clock, breakfast; and half-past nine, Mass;
at ten, reading till eleven. From eleven till
half-past eleven, a music lesson. At half-past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
eleven till twelve, drawing lesson. From
twelve to one, a lesson in geography and
history. At one o’clock, dinner and recreation
till three. At three o’clock, lessons in
writing and arithmetic till four. At four
o’clock, dancing lesson till five. Collation
and recreation till six; from six to seven, the
harp or the harpsichord. At seven, supper.
At half-past nine, the dormitory.”</p>

<p>The alternate days were arranged in the
same manner, but instead of receiving lessons
from masters unconnected with the Convent,
the children studied under the superintendence
of the ladies of the Abbey. On
Sundays and holy-days (these latter being
very numerous) the classes met at eight
o’clock, the Gospel was read, and then all
went to Mass at nine. At eleven the young
girls attended a short lesson given by the
directors, and at four o’clock went to Vespers.</p>

<p>Hélène has not omitted to portray the
mistresses of the blue class, and has sketched
them with irreverent precision: “Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
de Montluc, called Mother Quatre Temps,
kind, gentle, careful, too minute, and a busybody.</p>

<p>“Madame de Montbourcher, called Sainte
Macaire, kind, stupid, very ugly, believing in
ghosts.</p>

<p>“Madame de Fresnes, called Sainte
Bathilde, ugly and kind; tells us many
stories.”</p>

<p>Fifteen lay sisters performed the service
of the blue class.</p>

<p>Though Hélène belonged to the youngest
class, she had been temporarily placed in the
dormitory of the elder girls—a source of great
displeasure to them, as we shall soon see.</p>

<p>“About this time I began to fall ill, from
the effects of the Paris water. Monsieur
Portal<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> ordered me some powders, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
I was in bed, Madame de Sainte Bathilde,
the third mistress of the blue class, used to
come with a lay sister in order to make me
take them. On one occasion she forgot to
give them to me; and on that day the elder
girls were going to eat a pasty, and when the
door was locked they got up and began to
eat by the glimmer of a street lamp. When
I saw they were eating I said I wanted some,
and that if they did not give me any I should
tell. Upon which Mademoiselle d’Equilly
brought me a large piece of pie and crust,
which I devoured. But Madame de Sainte
Bathilde remembered that she had not given
me my powder, and got out of bed and
brought it me. No sooner did the young
ladies hear the key in the lock than they
all ran to their beds, and one of them put all
the fragments of the pasty into her bed.
Then the mistress and Sister Eloi came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
my side to give me my powder. As I did not
dare to say anything for fear of betraying
the girls, I was obliged to swallow the powder,
having just eaten a large piece of pie crust.</p>

<p>“When Madame de Sainte Bathilde was
gone the girls got up again; they grumbled
at me, saying it was insupportable to have a
tiresome brat like myself in their room, and
then they set to and drank some cider. I
called out again for some to be given me, but
they would not, because I had just taken a
powder, and even Mademoiselle de la Roche
Aymon came and slapped me, but I cried so
much that at last they were obliged to give
me a glass of cider, which I drank off at one
draught. Next morning I had violent fever,
and was carried to the infirmary. In the
night I was delirious, and a putrid fever came
on. I was at death’s door, and remained two
months at the infirmary.”</p>

<p>After this fine freak the health of the
little Princess was considered too delicate
for her to undergo the usual education. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
was therefore decided to give her separate
rooms, a nurse, a maid, and a <i>mie</i> (a nurserymaid),
her uncle having written to authorise
in advance all necessary expenses.</p>

<p>“My nurse,” she continues, “was called
Bathilde Toutevoix, and soon idolised me.
I was given a very fine apartment, allowed
four <i>louis</i><a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> a month for my pocket money, and
nothing was denied me for my keep and my
masters. Mr. Tourton, my banker, received
an order from my uncle to supply me up to
the sum of thirty thousand livres<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> a year if
necessary.</p>

<p>“About that time my nurse became very
cross with me. We had a cat that was very
fond of my nurse, and even of me, for whatever
I did to it it never scratched me, though
I often put it sufficiently out of temper to
make it growl like a mad thing. This cat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
was called <i>La Grise</i>. Once Mademoiselle
de Choiseul and myself were eating some
walnuts at the end of the passage leading to
the older part of the building; we had seated
ourselves on some steps there, when unfortunately
<i>La Grise</i> passed by. I called it
and it came to us, and while stroking it the
idea came into our heads to fasten the nutshells
on its paws. Mademoiselle de Choiseul
had some ribbon in her netting box, so we
carried out our plan, and <i>La Grise</i> was so
funny, for it could not stand up. We
laughed so loud that my nurse and Madame
de Sainte Monique heard us from my room;
they came downstairs and found <i>La Grise</i> in
this condition. My nurse nearly cried; she
scolded me very much and sent me to the
schoolroom. But that was not all. <i>La
Grise</i> always slept at the foot of my bed,
because my nurse thought it would keep me
warm. That evening, when my nurse had
gone to bed, being cross with <i>La Grise</i> for
having got me into disgrace I began kicking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
it so much that it got off my bed.
Then it went to lie down in the fireplace.
After a few minutes I put my head out of
my curtains to see what it was about, but
when I saw its two eyes glistening in the
fireplace I was frightened, and thought that
if I awoke in the night and saw those eyes I
should not know what they were. So I got
out of bed, took it up, and not knowing where
to put it, gently opened the press and shut it
up inside.</p>

<p>“Then the poor <i>Grise</i> began to mew and
moan so loud that my nurse got up, not
knowing what it could be. She looked about
everywhere, and at last discovered <i>La Grise</i>
in the press. I was so silly that I maintained
I had not put the cat there, and that apparently
it had got in by itself.</p>

<p>“My nurse said as that was the way I
hated <i>La Grise</i>, she would give it away the
very next day; then I cried so much and
screamed so loud that Mademoiselle de
Choiseul, Mesdemoiselles de Conflans, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
maid, and their maids ran into the room, not
knowing what could have happened. I told
them I was the most unhappy person in the
world, that my nurse wanted to give away
<i>La Grise</i>, that I could not live without it,
that I would have <i>La Grise</i>, it must be given
me at once, and I would beg its pardon.</p>

<p>“I had no rest till <i>La Grise</i> was put on my
bed; I took it in my arms, I embraced it, I
kissed its paws, and promised it I would never
do so again. Then my nurse said she consented
to keep <i>La Grise</i>, but that I should
have nothing but dry bread for breakfast next
day. I was only too happy to be let off so
easily; they all went back to their rooms and
I slept quietly the remainder of the night.”</p>

<p>Soon after, Hélène was brought to the
Confessional for the first time. Though only
eight years old, she followed the religious instructions
for some days, and Dom Thémines,
the pupils’ director, enjoined on her a
religious retreat to meditate on obedience;
a very good subject for a mischievous child.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
After the retreat she confessed, but unfortunately
has left us no record of her confession;
she came back rather tired, but satisfied with
her day’s work, and thinking herself quite a
grown up person. She continues her narrative
with charming ingenuousness.</p>

<p>“In the evening Sister Bichon came to
see my nurse, and while Mademoiselle Gioul,
my maid, was undressing me, Sister Bichon
begged me to remember her in my prayers
(for although I said them with the others in
the schoolroom, I was made to repeat them
before getting into bed). I said to Sister
Bichon: ‘What do you wish me to ask God
Almighty for you?’ She replied: ‘Pray to
God that He may make my soul as pure as
yours is at this moment.’ I therefore said
out loud, at the end of my prayer: ‘My God,
grant Sister Bichon that her soul may be
as white as mine ought to be at my age if I
had profited by the good teaching I have
received.’ My nurse was delighted at the
manner in which I had arranged my prayer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
and kissed me, as did also Sister Bichon,
Mademoiselle Gioul, and <i>mie</i> Claudine.
When I was in bed I asked if it was a sin to
pray for <i>La Grise</i>. My nurse and Sister
Bichon replied Yes, and that I must not
speak to God about <i>La Grise</i>.</p>

<p>“Then, as I was not sleepy, Sister Bichon
came to my bedside, and told me that if I
died that night, I should go immediately into
paradise; then I asked her what one saw in
paradise. She replied: ‘You must imagine,
my little darling, that paradise is a large room
all made of diamonds and rubies and
emeralds and other precious stones. God
Almighty sits on a throne, Jesus Christ is on
His right hand, and the Blessed Virgin on
His left; the Holy Ghost is perched on His
shoulder, and all the saints pass and repass
before Him.’ While she was telling me
this I fell asleep.”</p>

<p>There is always a certain truth and
simplicity about the little Princess’s narrative
which lend it a great charm; she praises or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
blames herself with entire good faith, and her
character becomes apparent at the end of a
few pages. The education in common, and
the intelligent management of Madame de
Rochechouart, had an excellent influence on
this spoilt and wayward child, accustomed to
see everything give way before her. But she
had to suffer at the beginning, and she relates
her first experiences in a most comical manner.</p>

<p>“I had at that time,” she says, “a
terrible aversion for good handwriting.
Monsieur Charme was very much displeased
with me, and set me back to write
nothing but O’s, which bored me very much,
and at the same time made the whole class
laugh at me: they said I should never be
able to sign my own name. It was not that
I absolutely hated writing; on the contrary, I
spent the whole day writing my <i>Memoirs</i>, as
was the fashion amongst the elder young
ladies at that time, and we, the younger class,
chose to do the same. I therefore scribbled
all day long, but it was such a scrawl that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
only I could read it, and, far from benefiting
me, it spoilt my hand. Mademoiselle de
Choiseul often wrote for me, but, as they
perceived it was not my writing, Monsieur
Charme complained of me to Mother Quatre
Temps. She asked me: ‘Mademoiselle, is it
you who have written this?’ I answered: ‘Yes,
Madame, in truth it is I.’ She said: ‘If it is
you, write out at once before me a similar
page.’ Then I was very much embarrassed,
I should have liked to have got into a mouse-hole.
What I wrote worst were the M’s and
N’s, and my copy was ‘Massinissa, roi de
Numidie.’ As every one knows, there are a
great many tops and tails in that name; and
there they were, all awry, one going one way,
the other another; in short, it was easy to see
that I was incapable of making such a copy.
Then Mother Quatre Temps fastened donkey’s
ears on to me, and because I had
told falsehoods hung a red tongue, together
with my copy, on my back. I began saying
that I wrote so badly because the table had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
been shaken; I was told that I slandered,
and the black tongue was added. The worst
of it was that Madame de Rochechouart,
who was rather pleased with me, and was
beginning to show me much kindness, had
told me at the morning class to go to her
cell that evening at six. But now the hour
was approaching, how could I make my
appearance in the state I was in? I would
sooner have died. Was I presentable with
donkey’s ears, two tongues, and a tattered
scrawl on my back? So when Mother
Quatre Temps told me to go to the <i>Maîtresse
Générale</i>, I would not leave my place, and I
cried enough to make my eyes start out of my
head. Mademoiselle de Choiseul was also
crying, and all my class pitied me. When
Mother Quatre Temps saw I would not obey
her, she added into the bargain the order of
ignominy, and sent for two lay sisters, Sister
Eloi and Sister Bichon, who took me by the
arms, dragged me from my stall, and conducted
me to the door of Madame de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Rochechouart’s cell. When I arrived there
I was so wretched that I felt my life was not
worth a pin. Directly I entered Madame
de Rochechouart called out and said: ‘Eh,
my heavens, what has happened to you? you
look like a merryandrew; what can you
have done to deserve being deprived of your
human figure?’ Then I threw myself at her
feet, and told her my faults. I saw she had
the greatest difficulty in the world to keep
herself from laughing; however, she said in a
severe manner: ‘Your faults are very great,
and your punishment is not great enough.’
Then she called in the two sisters who were
at the door, and she said: ‘I order Mademoiselle
to be reconducted to the schoolroom,
and to go without dessert for eight days; and
tell the head-mistress of the blue class to
come and speak to me.’ Madame de Rochechouart,
moreover, asked if I had met any
one on my way to her, and I said I had met the
doctor Monsieur Bordeu, and Madame la
Duchesse de Chatillon, who had come to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
one of her daughters who was sick. I was
brought back to the classroom, but I heard,
shortly after, some of the red class young
ladies say that Madame de Rochechouart had
said it was stupid to make such a guy of me,
and that she had soundly rated Mother
Quatre Temps, requesting her to punish her
scholars without disfiguring them; that a few
days before she had entered the schoolroom
and thought she must be looking at Egyptian
idols, on seeing five or six of us with asses
ears and three tongues, and as the Convent
was constantly full of strangers, it might
throw a ridicule on the education of the
pupils. From that time forth these punishments
were abolished, and instead we were
made to go on our knees in the middle of the
choir, we were deprived of dessert, given dry
bread at breakfast and collation, or made to
copy out the <i>Privilège du Roi</i><a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> during play-time,
which was very tedious.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>
<p>Hélène, however, was not at the end of
her tribulations, and her quick temper naturally
brought her into a few more.</p>

<p>“About that time I experienced from all
the class a bodily punishment which I resolved
long to remember. I was in the
habit of repeating to Madame de Sainte
Euphrasie everything that took place in the
class, and as I saw it met with success, I
listened to all the pupils said, so as to repeat
it to her, so much so that all the classes had
taken a dislike to me.</p>

<p>“I was at that time nine years of age. I
had a quarrel with Mademoiselle de Nagu;
she had taken from my drawer the short
<i>Lives of the Saints</i>, with pictures in it, and
was reading it. As I only allowed my most
intimate friends to rummage in my drawer,
I went to her and told her to return me my
book. She said: ‘This book amuses me,
you do not want to read it just now, I will
return it when I have finished it.’ I was
not satisfied with this answer, and tried to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
snatch it away from her; but, as she was
stronger than I, she gave me a sound box in
the ear; then, instead of giving her one in
return, I began to cry, and went and complained
to Madame de Saint Pierre, head-mistress
of the white class, as Nagu belonged
to that class. The mistress, seeing me in
tears, and my cheek red, called Mademoiselle
de Nagu, desired her to return me my book,
to ask my pardon, and condemned her to go
without dessert at supper. Every one pitied
Nagu, the more so that I was not liked.
Every one called me tell-tale, and hummed
in my ears, ‘Tell-tale-tit, go and tell our cat
to keep a place for you the day that you die.’</p>

<p>“But that was not all. Mademoiselle de
Choiseul and Mesdemoiselles de Conflans,
my three friends, were absent; Mademoiselle
de Choiseul was being inoculated, the others
were in the country, so that I had no one to
uphold me. On leaving the refectory it is
the custom to run as fast as possible to the
schoolroom, the mistresses, meanwhile, remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
behind. Instead of remaining with
them (for then no one could have touched
me), I was silly enough to be one of the first
to run. I unluckily found myself next to
Nagu, who said: ‘Ah, I have caught you,’
and at the same moment tripped me up, and
threw me down on my face. Then all the
young ladies began jumping over my body,
so that I received so many kicks that I was
bruised all over. The mistresses came to
me, and I was picked up, and the young
ladies said: ‘Mademoiselle, I beg your
pardon, I never saw you.’ Others said to
the mistresses, who scolded them: ‘I did not
do it on purpose, she was on the ground, I
did not see her.’ I was sent to bed, and the
next day Madame de Rochechouart came to
me. I told her my story, and she said: ‘If
your companions loved you, this would never
have happened; you must have great faults
of character for all the classes to be against
you.’ Since that day I have never repeated
the least thing to my mistresses, and I became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
so amiable that every one loved me, and
Nagu also, with whom I became such friends
that we would have gone through fire and
water for each other.</p>

<p>“But now is the moment to speak of the
game that was most in fashion at the Abbaye-aux-Bois.
It was the chase; but it required
a whole day to carry it out, and it could only
be played in the garden. They elected
huntsmen and whippers-in; then they chose
those who were to be the deer, and marked
one stag to lead. The younger class were
the hounds; and the red class always went
very politely and asked the blue class to take
that part in the game. When we were not
pleased with the red class we refused; and
even sometimes it has happened that, in the
middle of the game, the blues would leave
and go away, so that the stag could not be
run down.</p>

<p>“I had then an adventure for which I
revenged myself well. Among the older
girls of the red class there was a Mademoiselle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
de Sivrac who had a very handsome
face, but was subject to spasms, and was
rather crazy. We had had our recreation
in the garden, and as we were returning to
the schoolroom she said to me: ‘I have
forgotten my gloves at the end of the garden,
please come with me to fetch them.’ I
innocently accompanied her, but when we
were behind the lilac bushes she threw herself
on me, upset me, seized a branch of
lilac and whipped me cruelly. When she
had beaten me well she ran away. I picked
myself up as best I could, and returned
crying to the classroom. I thought: ‘If I
complain to the mistresses, Mademoiselle de
Sivrac will deny the fact; she will say she
only gave me a few slaps, and I shall again
be thought a tell-tale. What should I do?’
I called together all the most determined
girls of the blue class, and told them my
story, adding that if they did not revenge me
the blue class would soon be overpowered by
the older pupils; in fact, I stirred up their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
feelings as best I could, so that we declared
we would have no further intercourse with
the red class unless Mademoiselle de Sivrac
made me an apology.</p>

<p>“On the first holiday after this the red
class wished to play at the chase; they sent
to beg the blue class to lend them some girls
to act as hounds; but no one would go; and
it was the same for all the other games.
Then they asked what was the meaning of
brats like us being so stuck up.</p>

<p>“In reality they were very annoyed, for
the red class is the least numerous; the
white class is taken up with preparing for
their first communion, so that we were
absolutely necessary for any games requiring
a large number.</p>

<p>“This was not all; we broke open Mademoiselle
de Sivrac’s drawer and stall, tore
into atoms all her papers, and threw into the
well her purse, a pocket-book, and a comfit
box that we also found in it. Then the red
young ladies told Mesdemoiselles de Choiseul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
and de Montsauge, who were the most infuriated
because they were my friends, that
if they caught them alone they would box
their ears.</p>

<p>“From this moment there was the most
fearful disorder in the schoolroom. Anything
that was found belonging to the red class
was thrown into the well, or torn up by the
blue class; and whenever the reds could
catch the blues they beat them like plaster.
At last all this became known to the mistresses,
for at every moment the little ones were
seen with marks of pinches or scratches, and
when asked: ‘Who put you in that state?’
they replied: ‘The red young ladies.’ On
the other hand, the older girls lost their
books, found their copy-books torn and their
trinkets broken. The parents of both classes
spoke to Madame de Rochechouart, some
saying that their daughters were covered
with bumps and bruises, the others that their
daughters had lost or had all their things
torn up. Then Madame de Rochechouart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
came to the schoolroom and asked the blues
and reds what had given rise to all this
hatred. Mademoiselle de Choiseul came
forward and related my affair with Mademoiselle
de Sivrac.</p>

<p>“Madame de Rochechouart asked her why
she had whipped me, and she could give no
reason; but without Madame de Rochechouart
saying anything more to her, she came
up to me, begged my pardon, and kissed me.</p>

<p>“Madame de Rochechouart said that if
these quarrels continued the two classes would
have to be entirely separated; and she commanded
us to kiss each other. From that
day peace was re-established, and we no
longer willingly hurt each other.</p>

<p>“One day, while running in the garden, we
heard a subterranean noise, and looking
about to see where it could come from, at
last discovered that it issued from a drain-hole
which corresponded with the kitchen of
the Comte de Beaumanoir, whose mansion
was next door. Thereupon several of us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
formed a line, to hide what we were doing
from the mistresses, while the others began to
talk. We heard a little boy’s voice; we
asked him his name; he said it was ‘Jacquot,’
and that he had the honour of serving in the
Comte de Beaumanoir’s kitchen. We told
him the recreation hour was ending, but that
we should return next day at the same
hour.</p>

<p>“The following day he played the flute,
and we sang; then, as soon as one of us
spoke, he asked her name. He was told it,
and in three or four days he knew several by
the sound of their voices, and called out:
‘Halloo! D’Aumont! Damas! Mortemart!’
He inquired if one was fair or dark; and
then asked what we were doing in the
garden. We told him it was our collation
hour, and he replied that if it were not for an
iron grating in the middle of the drain he
would be able to give us some dainty morsels.
So we said he must try and remove the
grating, and he promised to do his best.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
We were so taken up by our conversation
that Madame de Saint Pierre, one of the
mistresses, was able to approach us without
our noticing it. When we saw her so near,
we all ran away, and Jacquot cried out:
‘Listen! Choiseul, Damas, the grating shall
be taken away to-morrow.’</p>

<p>“Madame de Saint Pierre went directly
to Madame de Rochechouart and told her
what had happened. Madame de Rochechouart
wrote at once to Monsieur de Beaumanoir,
that the drain leading from his
kitchen was going to be walled up, as his
servants talked with the scholars. He immediately
replied that he was extremely vexed
at what had happened, and that he was going
to dismiss all his kitchen servants. Madame
de Rochechouart begged he would not do so;
the masons were sent for, and the drain
walled up that very day. Madame de
Rochechouart did not consider it worth while
to come down to the schoolroom about such
an adventure. On the contrary, she thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
it would be attaching too much importance
to it; but in the evening, at the roll-call, she
made some jests about the delightful conquest
we had made, and added that we must have
very refined tastes and noble feelings to have
set such store by a scullion’s conversation;
and, that as for those who had given him
their names, she trusted he would at some
future time take advantage of their former
kindness, which would naturally be very
pleasant for their families. In this way she
humbled without scolding us.”</p>

<p>Madame de Rochechouart, a woman of
sound judgment and noble mind, soon became
very tenderly attached to the little Pole.
The child, almost abandoned, so far from her
own country, inspired her with real interest.
Each day she had her brought to her cell,
and without the child being aware of it,
watched her carefully. Hélène, who was
like a wild colt, felt a respect and at the
same time a sort of fear mingled with the
greatest admiration for the <i>Grande Maîtresse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Générale</i>. She constantly mentions her in
her <i>Memoirs</i>.</p>

<p>Madame de Rochechouart, sister of the
late Duc de Mortemart, was twenty-seven
years of age: “Tall, a handsome figure, a
pretty foot, hands delicate and white, splendid
teeth, large black eyes, a proud and grave
look, and a betwitching smile.” Such is the
portrait the little Princess has left us of her.
She was undoubtedly, after the Lady Abbess,
the most important person in the Abbey,
and directed as she chose the studies and
education of the pupils. It was thus that she
filled up the often tedious hours of a life and
calling she had not chosen. Madame de
Rochechouart had two sisters who were
beautiful and witty, like all the Mortemarts.
All three went through their novitiate when
hardly fifteen years old; for, according to the
cruel custom of those times, their fortunes
went entirely to the inheritor of the family
name. They pronounced their vows three
years after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“I stood in great fear of Madame de
Rochechouart in those days,” says Hélène.
“When she came to the classroom in the
morning and went the rounds, if by chance
she spoke to me, I immediately became embarrassed
and had trouble to collect myself
sufficiently to reply. Indeed, it may be said
that the whole class trembled before her, so
that when she came in of a morning, and we
were all returning in confusion from breakfast,
she would clap her hands and every one
would run to her stall, and one might have
heard a fly. When we made our curtsey
to her on entering the choir, I tried to read
in her eyes, and if I thought her look severe
I was in despair. I had got the habit of
tearing at full speed through the house; but
when I met Madame de Rochechouart, I
stopped dead short. Then, when she looked
at me, as her customary gaze is naturally
severe, I fancied I had displeased her, and
returned to the schoolroom quite disheartened,
saying: ‘Ah! Madame de Rochechouart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
has made big eyes at me.’ The others
replied: ‘How silly you are, do you expect
her to make her eyes smaller when she meets
you?’ This was told to Madame de
Rochechouart. The next time she saw me
she called me, and laughingly asked me if
she was looking at me the way I liked, and
if her eyes were still very alarming. I
answered that I thought them so beautiful
that they gave more pleasure than fear; and
she kissed me. She commands the love and
respect of all the pupils, and though a little
severe, is very just. We are all devoted to
her, and yet fear her. She is not demonstrative,
but a word from her has a most wonderful
effect. She is accused of being proud
and satirical to equals; but she is gracious
and kind to her inferiors; very well informed
and highly gifted.”</p>

<p>The story of the Vicar of Saint Eustache—Hélène in the white
class—Death of Mademoiselle de Montmorency.</p>
</div>

<p>Hélène had taken the greatest aversion to
Mother Quatre Temps and her punishments.
The more so that, thanks to her, she had
been twice delayed from promotion into the
white class, not being considered worthy of
preparation for her first communion.</p>

<p>“I was only consoled,” she says, “when
it was the hour of Mother Sainte Bathilde’s
superintendence, for she knew so many
stories that I was extremely amused by
them.</p>

<p>“She was very fond of me, for I was
always the most attentive listener directly
she began relating her stories. I remembered
every word she said, so that when she left us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
I was able to repeat her stories, without
omitting even one syllable. The whole blue
class knelt around me in order to hear better,
and even some of the white young ladies
occasionally listened too.</p>

<p>“When I had finished telling Madame de
Sainte Bathilde’s stories, I related those of
my grandmother, which were endless; for
while narrating, I invented all the incidents,
and they were most curious.</p>

<p>“No one could have replaced me with
Madame de Sainte Bathilde in the attention
I gave to the innumerable tales with which
she deluged the class, although Madame de
Rochechouart had several times requested
her to desist telling these foolish stories,
which made the pupils credulous and
frightened. The temptation was too great;
she began again every day. Sometimes she
herself had seen things, or else it was some
of her friends, till at last she told us a story
which nearly caused her dismissal from the
class. It was shortly after the death of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
Vicar of Saint Eustache, who had been found
dead one morning in his church. The Curate
of Saint Eustache, by name Mr. Giron, often
came to see Madame Sainte Bathilde. The
scholars had often seen him crossing the yard,
and had noticed that his neck was awry.
One day, when we were surrounding Mother
Sainte Bathilde in the schoolroom, and she
seemed more animated than usual, a pupil
told her that from one of the windows of the
depository<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> she had seen a priest pass by,
going to the tower, and that his neck
appeared to be twisted in a very peculiar
manner. Madame Sainte Bathilde replied
that he was coming to call on her, and was
the Curate of Saint Eustache, whose neck had
been dislocated by a most extraordinary
adventure. We begged her eagerly to relate
it. After having assured us that what she
was going to relate was truth itself, she began
as follows: ‘As we all know, the late Vicar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
of Saint Eustache rebuilt the front portal of
his church, and stood in need of fifteen thousand
livres<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> to finish it. He did not know
where to obtain the money. So one of his
friends advised him to consult a certain M.
Etteilla, who had the reputation of performing
wonders. The Vicar therefore went to him,
and told him that he was in absolute want
of fifteen thousand livres; begging him, if
possible, to procure that sum. After much
pressing M. Etteilla told the Vicar to meet
him a little before midnight in the church of
Saint Eustache, accompanied by only one person,
and that he would see what he could do
for him. The Vicar came punctually to the
appointed place, bringing with him Mr. Giron,
his Curate, whose neck at that time was as
straight as yours or mine. When they were
all three in the church, M. Etteilla drew a
circle around them and told them not to move
out of it, in spite of anything they might see;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
but that very soon they would see near them
a most appalling figure, who would inquire
what they wanted. In reply they were
to ask without hesitation for the sum of
money required, and the phantom would
present them with a purse, which they must
hasten to take. M. Etteilla then began his
incantations and closed the circle round the
Vicar and the Curate. It was not long before
they saw a kind of monster with horns rise
out of the ground, who asked them in a voice
of thunder: What they desired. The Vicar,
terrified, moved out of the circle, and the
monster felled him to the ground. He then
returned to the circle, within which the Curate
had remained, and repeated his question.
The Curate asked for the sum of fifteen thousand
livres. The monster held it out to him,
but in taking it, having advanced his head a
little too far, he received a blow which distorted
his neck for life. The incantation being over,
they went to pick up the Vicar, but found he
was dead. They therefore made up their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
minds to leave the body there, and so left the
church.’ The pupils having repeated this
story to several people, it came to Madame
de Rochechouart’s ears; so she sent for
Madame Sainte Bathilde, treated her with a
high hand, and told her that when the next
Chapter was held, she would have her
dismissed from the class.”</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the belief in
magicians was only the hobby of a credulous
old nun. On the contrary, it was widespread
at that time, and the most intelligent people
were not above consulting them. The Duc
d’Orléans and even the Prince de Ligne became
acquainted with the famous Etteilla.
The Prince says, in his unpublished writings,
called <i>Fragments des Mémoires</i>: ‘I very
much regret having paid so little attention to
the predictions of the great Etteilla. This
magician had just arrived in Paris. I took
M. le Duc d’Orléans to see him, Rue
Fromenteau, on the fourth floor. He could
not be acquainted with either of us. I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
that he spoke to him of a throne, of revolutions,
of the royal family, of Versailles, of the
Devil, but I only remember it all most confusedly.
It is a fact that Etteilla described
to Madame de Mérode the scene she
witnessed a fortnight later: her husband
(then in sound health) laid in state, with the
description of the room and the people in
it; all of which were unknown to him; and
that everything happened as he had predicted.
He also foretold that she would
marry again.’</p>

<p>Etteilla was only the anagram of the sham
magician’s real name. He was called Alliette,
sold engravings, and styled himself Professor
of Algebra in Paris,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> where in reality he
occupied himself with fortune-telling by cards.</p>

<p>“It is customary every year to distribute
prizes to the scholars on Saint Catherine’s
eve. It is always some married lady of rank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
who gives them away. The pupils contribute
towards the expense of the prizes, each giving
one louis. We were then a hundred and
sixty-two in number, which made a large
sum of money, and was all spent on books.
There are three prizes for each class, the
prizes being regulated as follows: Three
prizes for history and geography, three for
dancing, three for music, three for drawing.
This year it was Madame la Duchesse de la
Vallière who distributed them. I had the
first prize for history and the second for
dancing. Mademoiselle de Choiseul had the
first prize for dancing and the second for
history; but the fact was, we were about
equal both in history and in dancing, neither
M. Huart,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> M. Dauberval,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> nor even M.
Philippe<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> could manage to decide between
us. So, when we went up to receive the
prize from the hands of Madame la<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Duchesse,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Madame de Rochechouart told
us that as there was only a single first prize,
one of us should have it for history and the
other for dancing, but that we both deserved
them equally.”</p>

<p>This shows how great was the importance
attached to accomplishments, since the first
prizes for history and dancing were adjudged
together. Young as she was, Hélène really
danced remarkably well: “At that time,” she
says, “I danced the <i>farlànes</i> and <i>montférines</i>
(old French dances) most beautifully. Mademoiselle<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
came to our balls, and was so
pleased with my dancing that both she and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
Madame la Duchesse de Bourbon<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> always
begged that I should dance the <i>pas de deux</i>,
and they gave me comfits.”</p>

<p>Madame de Rochechouart knew what
pleased her little favourite, and often allowed
her to go out during this carnival. “Not a
week passed,” she says, “without my going
to four or five children’s balls at Madame de
la Vaupalière,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> hotel du Châtelet.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> At that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
time they were going to act <i>Athalie</i> at the
hotel de Mortemart.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> One day Madame de
Rochechouart made me read aloud the part
of Joas, and she was so pleased with the way
in which I read it that she spoke of it to her
niece, the young Duchesse de Mortemart,
who entreated, as a favour, that I should be
allowed to act that part at her house, where
they were going to perform <i>Athalie</i>. They
had no one to undertake the part of Joas,
Mademoiselle de Mortemart having no talent
for tragedy.”</p>

<p>The Dowager Duchesse de Mortemart
and the Duchesse d’Harcourt mentioned it
to the Abbess, who consented to the little
Princess going out three times a week during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
one month for the rehearsals. Molé was
sent for to direct the company. “I was
very happy,” Hélène writes, “for I always
brought back sweetmeats, and Mademoiselle
de Mortemart accompanied me. I went out
three days during the performances, and it
was thought that I acted better than the
child at the Comédie Française. M. Molé
recommended me particularly not to declaim
at all, but to speak naturally, without gestures,
as I would in conversation, and this succeeded
very well.”</p>

<p>A curious custom existed at the Abbaye-aux-Bois.
On Saint Catherine’s Day, in
honour of that saint, the pupils were allowed
to assume the dress, occupation, or rank of
all the ladies in the Convent, from the
Abbess down to the simplest nun. The
nominations took place by the majority of
votes, and the electoral body, composed of
all the pupils, solemnly met the day before
in the Chapter-house in order to vote.
This year Hélène was elected Abbess,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
and she relates the ceremony in its minutest
details:—</p>

<p>“The Chapter-house was lent us for the
elections. I was elected Abbess, and chose
Mademoiselle de Choiseul for <i>régente</i>; Mademoiselle
de Conflans was crosier-bearer,
Mademoiselle de Vaudreuil chaplain; Mesdemoiselles
de Damas, de Montsauge, de
Chauvigny, de Mortemart, and de Poyanne
were appointed as my personal attendants.
The remainder of the places were given by
majority of votes. When this was done, we
went to the Lady Abbess, who, according to
custom, kissed me, took off her cross, fastened
it on me, and put the <i>abbatial</i> ring on my
finger. I entered into office the very next
morning, and during High Mass, which we
sang, I was seated on the Abbess’s throne.</p>

<p>“It had been decorated with the carpet of
purple velvet fringed with gold, only used on
occasions of great ceremony. I received the
incense, and, preceded by the crozier, went to
kiss the paten. All the nuns heard Mass and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
the services from the galleries, and the
scholars occupied their stalls. I gave the
holy water, and received the public confession
of all the pupils. It was very funny to see
nuns of five and six years old. A great many
ladies came to see us in the choir and in the
refectory, where I gave a grand dinner with
ices. All the nuns and lady visitors were in
the middle of the refectory in order to see
us at table. Each of us put on the sedate
mien appropriate to the costume she wore.
After dinner we took possession of all the
different functions, while the nuns, by way of
a joke, settled themselves in the schoolrooms.
None of us, however, dared to go and see
Madame de Rochechouart; she could not
endure these masquerades, and had said
the day before that she wished to see no
one. As for Madame Sainte Delphine, all
this amused her intensely, and every one
went to see her, each in their turn; the
young Duchesse de Mortemart, Madame de
Fitz-James, Madame de Bouillon, Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
d’Henin, and the Vicomtesse de Laval spent
the afternoon with her. We flocked in
troops to see her; first, I went with all my
court. We were made to talk and converse;
in short, we greatly amused the ladies. But
what pleased us most was, that suddenly the
door opened and Madame de Rochechouart
entered. Then, as we knew she did not like
to see us like that, the Lady Abbess and her
retinue took to their heels and fled. In the
evening we went in state to carry back to the
Abbess her cross and her ring, and we doffed
our monastical clothes. The same festivities
are repeated on Innocents’ Day, and Mademoiselle
d’Aumont was Abbess. Concerning
the fear we had of displeasing Madame de
Rochechouart. Madame Sainte Delphine
was in the habit of saying that no Asiatic
monarch could be more despotic in his rule
than her sister was in hers, and it is true that
we had a real worship for her. I must say
in her praise that she rather influenced our
minds than our persons, for she seldom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
admonished or punished. We were perfectly
convinced it was impossible she could be
wrong in anything, and she inspired an unbounded
confidence. It is difficult to imagine
the extent of the enthusiasm Madame de
Rochechouart excited in the schoolroom; our
heads were turned with the honour we enjoyed
in having such a great lady to preside
over our education.</p>

<p>“The other mistresses, who depended on
her, were always quoting her name as that of
a divinity who punished or rewarded. The
Lady Abbess held her in great esteem, for she
allowed little intimacy. Those who saw her
frequently formed a kind of court around her.</p>

<p>“About that time, my nurse having left a
bottle of oil on the chimney-piece, Mademoiselle
de Choiseul and I discovered that by
rubbing oil on the door it could be opened
without any noise. My nurse slept in the
room next to mine. She was in the habit of
locking the door inside at night, leaving the
key in the lock. Mademoiselle de Choiseul’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
room opened into mine. She used, therefore,
to get up at night and come to my bedside;
then we slipped on our dressing-gowns, softly
opened the door, and ran about the house all
night, amusing ourselves by playing all kinds
of pranks; such as blowing out the lamps,
knocking at the doors, going and talking to
the novices and eating with them preserves,
pies, and sweetmeats which we had secretly
bought.</p>

<p>“Once we took a bottle of ink and poured
it into the basin for holy water at the door of
the choir. As the ladies go to Matins two
hours after midnight, and know them by
heart, there is no other light than that of a
lamp, which throws a very faint glimmer on
the holy-water vessel. They therefore took
the holy water, without perceiving the state
in which they put themselves; but as Matins
were finishing the day broke, when, seeing
each other so strangely marked, they laughed
one and all so loud that the service was
interrupted. It was suspected that this prank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
originated in the school, and on the following
day a search was made, but its authors were
never discovered.</p>

<p>“A few days afterwards we played
another trick. The bell-ropes, called ‘The
Gondi,’ because they had been blessed by the
Archbishop of Paris of that name, are used to
ring for the services on working days, and
are placed behind the choir, the larger and
more important bells being in another belfry
above the choir. These ropes pass through
a gallery situated behind the Abbess’s throne.
We therefore went up into this gallery and
tied our handkerchiefs tightly to the bell-ropes.
When the novice who had to ring
for Matins came, she pulled in vain. She
thought she was ringing; but when the rope
came to the knots it stopped, and the bells
did not move, so that the ladies who were
waiting for the first stroke of Matins to come
down never came, and the novice was exhausted
with ringing. At last some of the
nuns, seeing that the hour for Matins was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
going by, came down to see why no bells
were ringing. They found the nun half dead
with pulling the ropes. Then, perceiving
that something must be wrong with the bells,
they went up into the gallery and found the
handkerchiefs. Unfortunately our initials
were on them, H. M., J. C. They were,
therefore, taken to Madame de Rochechouart,
who inquired next day when she came into
the schoolroom to whom belonged the handkerchiefs
marked H. M. and J. C. Then we
hung our heads. Madame de Rochechouart
ordered us in a severe tone to leave our stalls,
so we came to her, trembling all over, and
knelt at her feet. She asked us if we
imagined these ladies were made to be the
butt of our practical jokes; she begged us not
to exert our ingenuity in tormenting them,
and said that, in order to remember this, we
should kneel in our night-caps the following
Sunday in the middle of the choir during
High Mass, as an apology to the ladies for
having amused ourselves at their expense;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
and also, that, as we were answerable to God
for the prayers which had not been said that
day, Matins having been curtailed, we should
have to recite out loud, during recreation, the
seven penitential Psalms.</p>

<p>“Some ill-disposed nuns, having excited
the Lady Abbess on the subject of these pranks,
she sent for Madame de Rochechouart, and
charged her with the disorders committed by
the class, and with their wicked and spiteful
behaviour. Madame de Rochechouart said
it was false; that no doubt some of the pupils
played tricks, but that as far as spite was concerned,
nothing had come to her ears, and,
moreover, that she had immediately punished
the offenders. Then the Lady Abbess cited
the tampering with the holy water as an act
of impiety. Madame de Rochechouart, who
was very quick tempered and hated mummeries,
replied that the deed was dark, because
it was a question of ink, but that it
was impossible for her to see it in any other
light than that of a child’s frolic, carried rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
too far she admitted, whereupon she left the
Lady Abbess in a tolerably bad temper.</p>

<p>“All the pranks Mademoiselle de Choiseul
and I had played had considerably retarded
the ceremony of my first communion. Mademoiselle
de Choiseul had been in the white
class for some time. As far as the lessons
were concerned, I ought to have been in
that class since the previous year, for I had
at my fingers’ ends all that was taught in the
blue class. I knew ancient history, the
history of France, and mythology very well;
I knew by heart the whole poem of <i>La Réligion</i>,
the <i>Fables of La Fontaine</i>, two cantos
of the <i>Henriade</i>, and all the tragedy of
<i>Athalie</i>, in which I had acted the part of
Joas. I danced very well; I knew how to
sol-fa; I played the harpsichord a little and
the harp a little; as for my drawing, that
was the least good; but these continual
pranks, into which I was partly drawn by my
weakness for Mademoiselle de Choiseul,
were very prejudicial to me. Every piece of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
mischief done was set down to our account.
I was so fond of Mademoiselle de Choiseul
that I preferred being in disgrace with her,
to seeing her punished alone. Her friendship
for me was reciprocal, and when I was
punished for any fault she went to the
mistresses and grumbled in a way that soon
caused her to share my disgrace. The whole
day was not long enough for the communications
we had to make to each other, and in
the evening, as her room opened into mine,
she came to me, or else I visited her. We
were both very fond of reading, and so
were Mesdemoiselles de Conflans: we read
together in all our spare moments, each
reading out loud in her turn.</p>

<p>“As we had left off our pranks for some
time, Madame de Rochechouart availed herself
of this opportunity to advance me into
the white class, for she quite worshipped me,
and was rather amused than angry at the
tricks I used to play. Madame de Sainte
Delphine, her sister, was also very fond of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
me; she always said it would be a loss to
the Convent if Choiseul and I became steady.
She said that my frolics always bore the
stamp of gaiety and wit, and, as a matter of
fact, my tricks never harmed any one, and
were always a subject of merriment.</p>

<p>“When my removal from the blue class
was decided, I went and begged Mother
Quatre Temps’s pardon for all the worry I
had given her, and thanked her for her kindness.
She told me she was very sorry to
be no longer on as intimate terms with
me, and that although I had occasionally
maddened her, there had been moments
which had compensated for all. I embraced
her.</p>

<p>“Several of my companions, Mademoiselle
de Chauvigny among them, had tears in their
eyes when Mother Quatre Temps came to
take off my blue ribbon.</p>

<p>“I was received with acclamations by the
white class, whose ribbon I received from
the hand of Madame de Saint Pierre, head-mistress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
of that class. The young ladies all
came and kissed me. Of the three mistresses,
Madame de Sainte Scholastique took my
fancy the most, and I resolved to do all in
my power to obtain her favour. She already
preferred my friend Mademoiselle de Choiseul
to all the other pupils.</p>

<p>“I was most anxious for the ceremony of
my first communion, and was desirous not to
remain long in the white class, where the
mistresses had the reputation of being very
severe.”</p>

<p>Hélène’s <i>Memoirs</i> prove that her intelligence
and character were now beginning to
develop in a remarkable manner. Her style
becomes bolder, and frees itself from the
childish phraseology in which she gives us
the story of the cat, or enlarges on Mother
Quatre Temps’s punishments. Moreover,
she will soon have more serious events to
relate.</p>

<p>“We had great sorrows about this time,
owing to the death of two of the pupils.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Mademoiselle de Chaponay<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> was the first
that died. She was nine years old, and had
a charming person. Mademoiselle de la
Roche Aymon<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> was very much grieved, as
she was her little mother. Mademoiselle de
Chaponay was carried to her grave by four of
the scholars, her coffin was covered with white
roses, and the church was all draped in white.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Montmorency’s<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> death
was far more dreadful.</p>

<p>“The Princesse de Montmorency wished
her daughter’s education to be conducted
with great severity. When she was twelve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
years old it was noticed that her figure was
growing awry. She might perhaps be alive still
if the suppositions of Madame de Saint Côme,
the head lady apothecaress, had been credited.</p>

<p>“Madame de Saint Côme said that Mademoiselle
de Montmorency suffered from a
vitiated state of the blood, which impeded
her growth, and that she was certain a treatment
of antiscorbutic herbs, taken in decoctions,
would purify the blood, when her
figure would straighten of itself. This the
Princesse de Montmorency would not admit.
However, she was called away from the
Convent on the occasion of her sister’s
marriage with M. le Due de Montmorency
Fosseuse, her cousin. She only returned
after an absence of six months, and then
quite unrecognisable. Without actual beauty,
she still had had a very pleasing appearance;
large fine black eyes, a white skin, a noble
and proud carriage. Now, she was most
fearfully emaciated, with a livid skin and
a hard cough. She informed us of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
marriage with the Prince de Lambesc,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
which was to take place during the course of
the winter. It was with great difficulty that
the persons interested had obtained his
consent to the match, for he did not wish to
marry, and it was only on their representing
to him that she was the greatest French
heiress, both in name and in fortune, that he
finally pledged his word.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile Mademoiselle de Montmorency’s
figure was decidedly growing awry;
and at last her mother put her under the care
of <i>Val d’Ajonc</i><a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> who tortured her for six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
weeks. She wore bandages day and night,
which aggravated the heated condition of her
blood, till at last, becoming quite ill, she lost
her hair and her teeth. One day she fell on
her arm, which brought on a tumour in the
armpit; the whole faculty in Paris was consulted
in vain; not one could cure this tumour.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile the winter advanced, and
considering the state she was in, it was
impossible to give her in marriage. Moreover,
M. de Lambesc told every one that he
had no affection for her, and even took no
trouble to conceal the repulsion he felt
towards her; in consequence the marriage
was postponed for a year.</p>

<p>“They determined to take the young girl
to Geneva in order to place her under the
care of the <i>Mountain Doctor</i>.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> She came to
say good-bye to us. She had retained her
beautiful eyes alone. I cried a great deal on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
leaving her; she was my little mother. She
gave me a keepsake in old lacquer, and told
me to pray for her, and to be very good.
She was much regretted, for she had a very
beautiful nature, and was loved by all.</p>

<p>“Three months after she had left I awoke
one night feeling very much agitated and
called my nurse. She came, and I said to
her: ‘Ah, I have just dreamt that I saw
Mademoiselle de Montmorency in a white
dress, and wearing a wreath of white roses;
she told me she was going to be married.
Since then I keep fancying that I see her two
large black eyes looking at me, and it frightens
me.’ A few days after we heard the news
of Mademoiselle de Montmorency’s death;
she had died the same night I dreamt of her.</p>

<p>“We heard that the bone of her arm had
decayed and was all rotting away. They had
tried to induce her mother to leave the room,
but she flung herself down on the threshold
of the door, sobbing most violently. When
Mademoiselle de Montmorency saw her arm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
had mortified, she said to Madame de la Salle,
a friend of her mother’s, who was with her:
‘Now death is beginning!’ Then Madame
de la Salle gently proposed her receiving the
Sacraments, and she consented.</p>

<p>“From that moment she ceased to see her
mother, whose mind had completely given
way. She begged Madame de la Salle to
ask her mother’s forgiveness for any trouble
she might have caused her; then she requested
her to tell Madame de Rochechouart,
that if she died, her greatest sorrow would be
not to have had her with her during her last
moments; then she gathered her attendants
round her, asked their forgiveness, and received
the Sacraments.</p>

<p>“Afterwards she sent for her doctor, and
begged him to tell her frankly if he thought
she would recover. Seeing he appeared embarrassed
and that Madame de la Salle was
crying, she said: ‘Ah! I did not know it was
so certain. Oh, my God! take all my fortune,
and call me back to life.’ Upon which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
he told her not to lose courage. ‘Yes,
she replied, ‘for I feel I need it all, to die at
fifteen.’</p>

<p>“However, the young Duchesse de Montmorency
and her husband arrived in the
evening with the Duc de Laval; the doctor
informed them she could not live through
the night, as the gangrene was rapidly
spreading.</p>

<p>“A few moments later Mademoiselle de
Montmorency asked for her mother, but she
could not come, for she was almost out of her
mind with grief. They told her she was ill.
She therefore asked for her sister, the
Duchesse de Montmorency, who came at
once. She said to her: ‘Tell all my companions
at the Abbaye-aux-Bois that I am
giving them a great example of the nothingness
of human life. I had everything to
make me happy in this world, and yet death
snatches me away from my high destiny.’
Then she gave her many particular messages
for Madame d’Equilly and Madame de la<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Faluère, and said she was to tell me to pray
to God for my little mother.</p>

<p>“She asked for her confessor, and said to
him: ‘Well, since I must die, you must teach
me how to renounce life, for surely I should
have the merit of such a sacrifice.’ Then the
confessor brought a crucifix and began reciting
the psalms, but he avoided those for
the dying. Then she said: ‘Ah, I no longer
suffer!’ For the last two days indeed she
had hardly suffered, but previous to this she
had gnawed her sheets with frenzy, and her
screams could be heard a long way off. She
asked for a peppermint lozenge, they put one
in her mouth, she made an effort as though
to cough, and expired.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>
<p>“When her death was announced to the
class the grief was universal, and I in
particular wept much for her. A magnificent
commemorative service was held, which was
founded in perpetuity to her memory by the
payment of a sum of forty thousand francs.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>“There is one anecdote which I have heard
related about Mademoiselle de Montmorency
which shows that she possessed some native
energy of character.</p>

<p>“When she was about eight or nine years
old, and Madame de Richelieu was the ruling
power, she one day behaved with great
obstinacy towards the Lady Abbess, who said
angrily to her: ‘When I see you like that, I
could kill you.’ Mademoiselle de Montmorency
replied: ‘It would not be the first time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
that the Richelieus had been the murderers of
the Montmorencys.’”</p>

<p>Such a haughty answer in the mouth of a
child is surprising enough, but it shows the
extraordinary development of children at
that period; and the account that Hélène
herself gives of the death of her companion
is a striking proof of this. It is impossible
to relate a story better; not a line is wanting
in the picture; and the simplicity of the style
adds yet more to the effect of the narrative.</p>

<p>Moles and niggers—Mutiny in the Convent—Marriage of
Mademoiselle de Bourbonne—The first communion.</p>

</div>
<p>“About this time Dom Rigoley de Juvigny
having come to confess a nun, happened to
be in the cloisters at the moment when the
class was leaving Mass, so that he was seen
by all the pupils, and was the butt of all their
jokes.</p>

<p>“If it had been Dom Thémines, our own
confessor, we should not have allowed ourselves
all these jokes, but we thought it of no
consequence when it was the nuns’ confessor.
So one said one thing, one another.</p>

<p>“There was then in the red class a mistress
we could not endure, called Madame de
Saint Jérôme. As her complexion was very
dark, and Dom Rigoley’s also, some of us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
declared that if they were married their
offspring would be moles and little niggers.
Although it was very silly, this joke became
so much the fashion that in the whole class
we talked of nothing but moles and little
niggers; and when we quarrelled we said to
each other: ‘Do you take me for a mole, or
for a little nigger?’</p>

<p>“However, as it was chiefly in our class
(the white one) that this joke had been made,
and as some of us were in the midst of our
devotions preparing for the approaching first
communion, we reproached ourselves very
much for this joke. So we determined to
confess it; but as about thirty of us were
guilty, we wrote a letter in which we said we
had sinned against modesty and charity by
saying that if Dom Rigoley married Madame
de Saint Jérôme, moles and little niggers
would be the result; and we sent the letter
to Dom Thémines. This became known
all through the establishment, and was much
laughed at; but Madame de Saint Jérôme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
took a great aversion to the white class.
But then, there was not a single pupil whom
she liked or who liked her.</p>

<p>“This worried and vexed Madame de
Rochechouart, who said that she had already
for some time past begged that new elections
should be held, and that Madame de Saint
Jérôme should be deprived of her place,
since she was not fit for it. For, during the
six months she had occupied that post
she had succeeded in making herself universally
hated, without being feared by her
pupils, since even the blue class amused
itself by covering her with ridicule. That
she was made the subject of all the satires,
songs, and lampoons that were stuck up in
All Souls’ cloisters, that she had not the
necessary coolness to deal with children, and
that when she inflicted punishments she
always did so when beside herself with anger.
The Lady Abbess told Madame de Rochechouart
that it was impossible for her to attend
to this, and that she must speak to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
Mother Prioress about it. The Prioress said
they would have to hold a general Chapter
meeting, and that it was not worth while
calling one together for that purpose; as one
was going to be held shortly, it would then
be possible to make a change in the school.
Then Madame de Rochechouart became
very angry, and said she could not answer
for the disturbances that such a hot-headed
person might occasion amongst a hundred
and sixty pupils. As ill luck would have it,
rumours of this dispute reached our ears, and
we heard that Madame de Saint Jérôme continued
in the schoolroom against the wish
of Madame <i>la Maîtresse Générale</i>.</p>

<p>“A short time after the Chapter assembled;
but Madame de Rochechouart could not be
present at it, as she had a cold. The other
mistresses had not the courage to propose to
the Chapter the removal of Madame de Saint
Jérôme, so that she remained in the schoolroom.
Madame de Rochechouart was extremely
vexed at this. Then the pupils,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
with Mesdemoiselles de Mortemart, de
Choiseul, de Chauvigny, de Conflans and
myself at their head, resolved to seize the
first opportunity of perpetrating some grand
stroke which would oblige her to leave the
class.”</p>

<p>While waiting to execute their plans, the
leaders of the conspiracy, acting with prudence,
wished to satisfy themselves as to the
number of their followers. Hélène relates
this with all the solemnity of a politician:—</p>

<p>“We called together a meeting of five or
six pupils of each class, and it was agreed
that those who did not like Madame de
Saint Jérôme, and who were determined to
do everything they could to have her removed,
should wear green; that is, either a
leaf, or a bit of weed, or a ribbon, in fact
something green; that each of those who
were present at this meeting should make
her friends in her class wear green, and that
in order to be able to recognise each other
and avoid explanations which might be over-heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
when we met, we would say ‘Je vous
prends sans vert.’ (I catch you unawares.)
That then we would show the colour, and
those who had not got it would be considered
as not belonging to the mutinous party; and
that as it was very possible that either from
timidity or other reasons some of the pupils
would change their minds, those persons
should then be obliged to leave off wearing
the green; so that in this way there would
be no mistake as to who belonged to the
league.”</p>

<p>An opportunity soon occurred for putting
these fine plans into execution.</p>

<p>“One holiday, on the eve of Saint
Magdalene, who was the patron saint of the
Lady Abbess, all the pupils had left their
departments to come and play in the schoolroom.
As we already had had recreation for
two days, all the mistresses were tired out;
so they had agreed, in order to have some
rest, to remain only one at a time in the
schoolroom. About four o’clock Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
de Saint Jérôme’s turn came, and we took it
into our heads not to do a single thing she
should tell us. All of a sudden the little de
Lastic<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and the little de Saint Simon girls
began quarrelling, and ended by coming to
fisticuffs. Madame de Saint Jérôme went up
to separate them, and without knowing who
was right or wrong, she took Mademoiselle
de Lastic by the arm, and tried to make her
go down on her knees. Mademoiselle de
Lastic said: ‘Madame, I assure you, it was
not I who began.’ Thereupon Madame de
Saint Jérôme flew into a dreadful rage, seized
Mademoiselle de Lastic by the neck, and
threw her down so violently that she fell on
her nose, which began to bleed. When we
saw the blood we gathered round her, and
swore that not only we should not allow her
to be punished, but that we would throw
Madame de Saint Jérôme out of the window,
because she had murdered one of us.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
Madame de Saint Jérôme was so frightened
at our screams, and the noise we made,
that she quite lost her head. She was
afraid of some violence, seeing how excited
we were. She therefore resolved to retreat,
saying she would go and complain to
Madame de Rochechouart. It was a great
mistake on her part to leave the class at such
a moment without a mistress. Mortemart<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
got on the table and said: ‘Let all those who
have green show it.’ Then every one did so,
and those who had none begged the others
to give them some. On seeing that our party
was so strong, Mortemart said we must
withdraw from the schoolroom, and return
only under conditions both advantageous
and honourable. It was decided to go
through the garden, secure the kitchen and
larders, and reduce the ladies by famine.</p>

<p>“We therefore crossed the garden, and
went to the building containing the kitchens.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
This building had only one floor; on which
were the storerooms, the larders, and the
bakery. The kitchens were underground.
We first entered the storeroom, where we
only found Madame Saint Isidore and Sister
Martha. We very politely begged them to
leave, and they were so frightened on seeing
us that they went away at once. The larders
and the bakery being shut up, we proposed
to burst them open; then we went down into
the kitchens, after having left one of our party
in the storeroom. We were rather astonished
to find a number of people in the kitchens,
amongst others one of the schoolmistresses,
Madame de Saint Antoine, for whom we had
great respect. She asked us what we
wanted: Mademoiselle de Mortemart replied
that we had fled from the schoolroom because
Madame de Saint Jérôme had broken the
head of one of the pupils. Startled at this
piece of news, she did not know what to
say; she, however, tried to induce us to return,
but we told her it was useless. Then she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
left us and ran to the schoolroom to verify it
all. Madame de Saint Amélie, head of the
kitchen department, tried to turn us out, but
we turned her out. As for Madame de
Saint Sulpice, who was sixteen years old, she
wanted to leave, but we would not allow her;
we told her that we should keep her as a
witness that we did not waste the provisions
of the establishment. We wanted to
turn out the lay sisters, but Madame de Saint
Sulpice having represented to us that in that
case we should have no supper, we kept
Sister Clothilde. Then we bolted the doors
opening into the refectory, and left those on the
gardens open; but about thirty of the pupils
remained to guard them. We then resolved
to capitulate, and these were our terms:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘<i>The United Scholars of the Three Classes
of the Abbaye-aux-Bois, to Madame de
Rochechouart, Maîtresse Générale.</i></p>

<p>“‘We entreat your forgiveness, Madame,
for the measures that we have taken; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
cruelty and incapacity of Madame de Saint
Jérôme forced them upon us. We request a
general amnesty for the past, that Madame
de Saint Jérôme shall not put her foot again
inside the schoolroom, and that we have
eight days’ recreation, to rest our bodies
and minds after the fatigues we have undergone.
As soon as we shall have obtained
justice, we will return and submit ourselves
to whatever it may please you to dictate.</p>

<p>“‘We have the honour to remain, with
the deepest respect and tenderest attachment,
Madame, etc.</p>

<p>“‘<i>P.S.</i>—We send two of our party as
bearers of this petition. If they are not sent
back to us, we shall consider it a sign that
you do not choose to treat with us: in which
case we shall go in open force to fetch
Madame de Saint Jérôme and whip her
round the four corners of the Convent.’</p>
</div>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Choiseul offered to carry
the letter, and I consented to accompany her.
When we came to the end of the garden we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
saw a numerous assembly of nuns and sisters,
brought thither by curiosity, to see what the
pupils would do. But none of them dared
to approach the building. When they saw
us they came up to us, saying: ‘Well, what
are the rebels about?’ We answered that
we were taking their proposals to Madame
de Rochechouart.</p>

<p>“We entered her cell, but she looked at
us with an air of such severity that I turned
quite pale, and Choiseul, bold as she was,
trembled. Madame de Rochechouart asked
whether the young ladies were in the schoolroom.
We said no. ‘Then,’ said she, ‘I
will listen to nothing from them; you may
carry your complaint to the Lady Abbess, or
to any one you choose; I will have nothing
to do in the matter, and you have taken the
best means of disgusting me with trying to
manage such a set of madcaps, more fit to be
enlisted amongst the followers of some army
than to acquire the modesty and gentleness
which are the charm of woman.’ We were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
much confused, and Mademoiselle de Choiseul,
who had more courage than I, threw herself
at her feet and said that a word from her
would always be sovereign law, and that she
did not doubt that each one felt the same,
but that in an affair of honour we would
sooner die than seem to betray or abandon
our companions. ‘Well,’ said Madame de
Rochechouart, ‘speak to whom you will, for I
have ceased to be your mistress.’ We left
her, and went to the abbatial rooms. The
Lady Abbess read our petition, but not in our
presence; we only knew that Madame de
Rochechouart was sent for, but we did not
hear what took place. Only when the Lady
Abbess received us, she told us such conduct
was unheard of, that such an event had
never occurred before, even in a college,
and she asked who was at the head of the
rebellion. We answered that it had been
the inspiration of the moment, and that it
seemed as if the whole class had had but
one mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>“Madame de Rochechouart was there, and
did not say a word. ‘Well,’ said the Lady
Abbess, ‘if the young ladies will return, I will
grant a general amnesty, but that is all I
can do. As for Madame de Saint Jérôme,
she is a person of great merit, and this fine
hatred of her is a mere whim.’ However,
we went our way back to the kitchens. All
the people we met questioned us. When we
got back everybody surrounded us, saying:
‘What news?’—‘None!’ we answered
mournfully. Then we told them what had
been said to us; and the young ladies soon
made up their minds. They begged Madame
de Saint Sulpice to give out the provisions.
Madame de Saint Sulpice said she was only
assistant nun in the kitchens, and had not
got the keys. Then we broke open the
doors of the bakery and meat-store, and
Sister Clothilde, after some resistance, was
obliged to give in to numbers, and prepared
the supper, which was very merry. We did
a thousand foolish things; we drank Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
de Rochechcuart’s health, and the affection
the pupils all had for her is proved by this,
that our only fear was lest she should
leave the class; but we said to ourselves,
that in the bottom of her heart she would
forgive us all this; one of the chief reasons
that had made us take a dislike to Madame
de Saint Jérôme being that Madame de
Rochechouart did not approve of her being
in the schoolroom. The best joke was that
Madame de Saint Sulpice, who was lively
and amiable, was in the best possible spirits,
and was quite reconciled to having been so
forcibly detained. After supper we played
at all sorts of games, and she played with
us. She kept saying that she seemed to be
there as a hostage, and that if the young
ladies were not pleased she would be
the one to blame. When bedtime came
we made up a sort of couch, with some
straw, which we took from the backyard.
It was decided that this couch should be
for Madame de Saint Sulpice, but she refused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
it, and said we must give it up to the
youngest girls, who were the most delicate.
We therefore settled on it the little Fitz-James,
Villequier, Montmorency, and several
other children of five or six years of age. We
wrapped up their heads in napkins and clean
kitchen cloths, so that they should not catch
cold. About thirty of the older girls posted
themselves in the garden before the door, for
fear of a surprise. The others remained in
the kitchens. And so we spent the night,
partly in talking, partly in sleeping, as best
we could. Next morning we prepared to
spend the day in the same way, and we felt
as if this state of things was to last all our
lives. However, as we afterwards heard,
they were all in a great state of perplexity
at the Convent. Some were of a mind to
frighten us by calling in the patrol; but
Madame de Rochechouart said the real mischief
would lie in the scandal this would occasion,
and that it would be more advisable
to send for the mothers of those pupils who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
were supposed to be the ringleaders. Accordingly
Madame la Duchesse de Châtillon,
Madame de Mortemart, Madame de Blot,
Madame du Châtelet arrived. They came
to our camp, and called their daughters and
their nieces. These did not dare to resist, and
so they carried them off. Then a lay sister
was despatched to the pupils to say that the
schoolroom was open, that it was ten o’clock,
and that all those who should be back in
class by twelve would have a general pardon
for past conduct. After a great consultation,
the principal mutineers being gone, we
all returned and ranged ourselves in our
places. We found all the mistresses assembled,
and even Madame de Saint Jérôme,
who seemed rather embarrassed, was there.
Madame Saint Antoine said we deserved to
be punished, but, however, that it was the
return of the prodigal child. This mistress
was at the head of the red class,—she belonged
to the Talleyrand family,—and was much beloved
and respected. Madame Saint Jean was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
delighted to see us back; she told us she had
felt very dull during our absence; in fact all
the mistresses were most indulgent.</p>

<p>“It was with much dread that we looked
forward to the moment when we should have
to appear before Madame de Rochechouart.
This was not till the evening, when the
names were called over. Much to our astonishment,
she did not say one word about
what had happened; and indeed, some of us
innocently persuaded ourselves that she had
altogether ignored it. As for me, when the
Duchesse de Mortemart had come to ask for
her daughter, she had said to me: ‘My
sister-in-law has had great pleasure in acting
as a mother toward you; it is for you to show
whether you mean to confirm that title by
obeying her orders. She has asked for you.
Let us go to her.’ I immediately followed
the Duchesse de Mortemart and her
daughter. We were taken to the schoolroom,
whither the remainder of the scholars
shortly after returned. I only saw Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
de Rochechouart in the evening, when our
names were called. When my turn came,
she looked at me with a smile, and chucked
me under the chin, and I kissed her hand.
The next day everything resumed its usual
course.</p>

<p>“Madame de Saint Jérôme was left for
another month in the schoolroom, and then
removed to other functions. About thirty of
the pupils had not joined in the insurrection,
amongst others Lévis, and they were simply
wretched. They were tormented and run
down by the whole class; they had fancied
they would gain great credit by their conduct;
but Madame de Rochechouart did not like
them any the better for it. One of them
said one day to Madame de Rochechouart:
‘I was not in the insurrection,’ and Madame
de Rochechouart answered, in an absent
manner: ‘I compliment you.’”</p>

<p>Shortly after this memorable episode the
young girls were much interested in the
marriage of one of their companions,—Mademoiselle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
de Bourbonne,—and Hélène
does not fail to describe it.</p>

<p>“One day Mademoiselle de Bourbonne
returned from her stay in society looking
very depressed, and remained a long time
with Madame de Rochechouart. The next
day all her relations came to see Madame de
Rochechouart, and ten days later she came
to us, conducted by Mesdemoiselles de
Châtillon, the eldest of whom was her great
friend, to announce her marriage with M. le
Comte d’Avaux, son of M. le Marquis de
Mesme. We all gathered round her, and
asked her a hundred questions. She was
barely twelve years old, was to make her
first communion a week thence, to be married
eight days after that, and then return to the
Convent.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> She seemed so very melancholy
that we asked her if her intended did not
please her. She frankly told us that he was
very ugly and very old, and she added that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
he was coming to see her the next day. We
begged the Lady Abbess to have the Orléans
apartments, which looked on to the Abbatial
court, thrown open to us, so that we
might view the intended husband of our
companion, and she granted our request.</p>

<p>“The next day, on awaking, Mademoiselle
de Bourbonne received a large bouquet, and
in the afternoon M. d’Avaux came. We
thought him horrible, which he certainly was.
When Mademoiselle de Bourbonne came out
of the parlour, we all said to her: ‘Ah! good
heavens! how ugly your husband is; if I were
you, I would not marry him. Ah! you unfortunate
girl!’ And she said: ‘Oh, I shall
marry him, because papa insists upon it; but
I shall not love him, that is certain.’ It was
decided that she should not see him again
till the day she made her first communion, so
that her attention should not be distracted.
She made her first communion at the end of
eight days, and four or five days after was
married in the chapel of the hôtel d’Havré.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>“She returned to the Convent the same
day. She was given jewels, diamonds, and
magnificent wedding presents from Boland;
what amused her most was that we all called
her Madame d’Avaux. She told us that after
the wedding ceremony there had been a
breakfast at her mother-in-law’s; that they
had wanted her to kiss her husband, but that
she began to cry, and absolutely refused; and
that then her mother-in-law had said she was
only a child. Henceforth her strong aversion
to her husband only grew and flourished, and
once when he asked for her in the parlour,
she pretended to have sprained her ankle
sooner than go down to see him.”</p>

<p>On hearing of such marriages it is
impossible not to feel some indulgence for the
theory of free choice so eloquently pleaded
by the women and philosophers of that
period. We are therefore scarcely surprised
to hear that some years later Madame
d’Avaux, on meeting in society the Vicomte
de Sègur, youngest brother of the ambassador,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
was so captivated by his charming wit
and personal attractions that she was drawn
into an intimacy which lasted all her life.</p>

<p>The arch and ingenuous narrative of the
little Princess also enables us to touch the
weak point in this Convent education, so
admirable in many respects. These young
girls, brought up away from a world they
were burning to know, were destined beforehand
to be carried away by its temptations.
How was it possible for the nuns to warn
them against dangers of which they themselves
were ignorant? A mother alone can
fulfil that duty; and though the Convent may
form the character and manners, adorn the
mind and develop accomplishments, it is
family life alone that can create <i>woman</i> in
the highest and healthiest sense of the
word.</p>

<p>But let us return to Hélène, who was preparing
for her first communion, together with
her friends Mesdemoiselles de Mortemart,
de Châtillon, de Damas, de Montsauge, de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
Conflans, de Vaudreuil,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and de Chauvigny.
The great day arrived, and the young friends
partook together of the communion.</p>

<p>“On that day,” says Hélène, “the pupils
do not wear their Convent dress, but a white
gown, striped or embroidered in silver. Mine
was in watered silk striped with silver. Nine
days after we made a gift of our dresses to
the vestry. We folded our gowns, fetched
from the vestry large silver salvers, and after
the Gospel, during the offertory, we went one
after the other and laid our gift on the altar
next to the choir. After Mass we went to
the schoolroom, where our white ribbons
were taken off and red ones given us instead,
and all the class embraced and congratulated
us.”</p>

<p>When the retreat that followed the first

in order to decide what should be the function

<p>It was an established custom at the
Abbaye-aux-Bois for the pupils to perform
the duties of the Convent in its nine different
offices, which were as follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>A certain number of lay sisters were
associated with them in these employments,
which only occupied a limited number of
hours, and did not interfere with accomplishments,
but formed the greatest contrast with
them, as well as with the aristocratic names
of the young ladies. Mesdemoiselles de la
Roche Aymon and de Montbarrey could be
seen carefully arranging the piles of napkins
and sheets in the presses, while Mesdemoiselles
de Chauvigny and de Nantouillet
laid the cloth; Mesdemoiselles de Beaumont
and d’Armaillé added up the accounts; Mademoiselle
d’Aiguillon mended a chasuble;
Mademoiselle de Barbantanne was on duty
at the gate; Mademoiselle de Latour-Maubourg
gave out the sugar and the coffee;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
Mesdemoiselles de Talleyrand and de Duras
were at the orders of the community; Mademoiselle
de Vogüé had a particular talent
for cooking; and Mesdemoiselles d’Uzès
and de Boulainvilliers superintended the
sweeping of the dormitories, under the direction
of Madame de Bussy, irreverently nicknamed
by the pupils <i>la mère Graillon</i>;
finally, Mesdemoiselles de Saint Simon and
de Talmont were responsible for repairs;
and Mesdemoiselles d’Harcourt, de Rohan-Guéménée,
de Brassac, and de Galaar lighted
the lamps, under the supervision of Madame
de Royaume, whom they called <i>the Mother of
Light</i>.</p>

<p>After having acted the part of <i>Esther</i> in a
dress embroidered with diamonds and pearls
worth a hundred thousand écus,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Hélène
returned to the Convent, and, resuming her
little black frock again, prepared decoctions
and poultices in the dispensary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>
<p>Such an education may appear strange to
us, but it unquestionably prepared excellent
housekeepers and accomplished women of
the world.</p>

<p>“I was very anxious,” Hélène says, “that
we should not be separated, and that we
should be placed together in the dispensary.
On the contrary, I was sent to the abbey-house,
and Mademoiselle de Choiseul to the
record office. Mesdemoiselles de Conflans,
who did not know how to hold a needle, were
sent to the sacristy. This made us very
cross.</p>

<p>“However, if Mademoiselle de Choiseul
had been with me, I should have been very
happy at the abbey-house, where the Lady
Abbess<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> ruled with the greatest gentleness
and justice. She had taken a great liking to
me; she considered that I did her commissions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
with intelligence. I was quick, and
when she rang I was always the first to
come; I knew her books, her papers, her
work, and was always the one she sent to
fetch what she required from her desk, her
bookshelf, or her chiffonier.”</p>

<p>Hélène’s companions at the abbey-house
were apparently amiable, judging by the
record she has left us.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Châtillon, nicknamed
<i>Tatillon</i> (busybody), fourteen years old,
serious, pedantic, very pretty, but rather
stout.</p>

<p>“Madame d’Avaux, born a Bourbonne,
twelve years old, just married, very small, a
pretty face, silly, but good-natured.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Mura, nicknamed <i>la
Précieuse</i> (the conceited), eighteen years old,
pretty, handsome even, witty, amiable, but
rather pretentious.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Lauraguais, very pretty,
quiet, gentle, not clever; was married the
same year to the Duc d’Aremberg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Manicamp, her sister,
plain, kind, very intelligent, hasty, passionate.</p>

<p>“I had become very intimate with Madame
de Sainte Gertrude and Madame Saint
Cyprien; they were regular madcaps, fond of
laughter and amusement. Mademoiselle de
Manicamp was also a great addition to society.
Madame d’Avaux used to tell us so very
frankly that she cordially detested her
husband, that we were always joking about
it; and openly made fun of him whenever he
came to see her, as unfortunately for him the
windows of the Abbess’s apartments looked
out on the yard, so that it was impossible for
him to avoid our mischievous glances.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Mortemart was also on
duty at the abbey-house, and her presence
alone was sufficient to banish all dulness and
melancholy. We laughed at the grand airs
Madame de Torcy gave herself, and maintained
that she had only become a nun because
she had found in Jesus Christ alone a spouse
worthy of her, and even then she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
not quite sure she had not made a
<i>mésalliance</i>!</p>

<p>“Madame de Romelin, all bristling over
with Greek and Latin, amused us also; we
called her Aristotle’s eldest daughter; this
did not make her angry, as she was very
good-natured.</p>

<p>“But our great delight was to establish the
pretentious Mura at the harpsichord; then
she sang, and Madame de Sainte Gertrude,
who was extremely merry and an excellent
mimic, stood behind her, and imitated all her
affectations.</p>

<p>“A great many people also came to ask for
permits, or to speak to Madame de Royer, or
to the Lady Abbess.</p>

<p>“This dissipation might suit a good many
other people, but for my part I was rather
bored by the functions at the abbey-house;
I do not know why, but this fashion of
dancing attendance on others seemed to
me humiliating.”</p>

<p>It was the custom at the Abbaye-aux-Bois<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
to give a ball once a week during the
carnival.</p>

<p>“On that day,” says the young Princess,
“we laid aside our school dress, and every
mother decked out her daughter as well as
she could; our attire on these occasions was
most elegant. A great many women of the
world attended our balls, especially young
married ladies, who, not being able to go out
alone, preferred them to those of the fashionable
world, as they were not obliged to remain
all the time seated next to their mothers-in-law.”</p>

<p>It is evident that already at this period a
young married woman dreaded the tyranny
of a mother-in-law, who indeed exercised a
far greater authority over her than even her
own mother. The mother-in-law was alone
privileged to accompany the young married
woman in society. Probably it was reasonable
enough to expect less indulgence on her
part than on a mother’s, and the husband
preferred this safeguard, precluded as he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
by custom and the fear of exciting ridicule
from watching or even noticing his wife.
We shall see that the supervision of the
mother-in-law could ill be dispensed with for
some of these giddy young women.</p>

<p>“One day, when Madame de Luynes<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
and Madame de la Roche Aymon<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> were at
the ball, they sent away their carriages, and
hid themselves in Mademoiselle d’Aumont’s<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
apartment. After the bell had been rung
for silence, they began making the most
horrible noise, which they kept up in the
Convent throughout the night. They broke
all the pitchers that are put outside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
ladies’ cells; they stopped all the nuns
whom they met going to Matins; in fact,
they made a most diabolical noise.</p>

<p>“The Lady Abbess gave orders that these
ladies should not be in any way insulted, but
that they should be given no food, and not
be allowed to leave the Convent. When
eleven o’clock struck, they asked for something
to eat, but they were refused; then they
requested that the gates should be opened,
but Madame de Saint Jacques, who was
head portress, said that the keys were at the
Lady Abbess’s. Then they sent Mademoiselle
d’Aumont to beg the Lady Abbess to
have the doors opened for them. The Lady
Abbess sent them word that having remained
without her permission, they should not leave
till their families came to fetch them away;
upon which they were in despair. Madame
de Rochechouart, on the other hand, warned
them to be careful when the pupils were
going or returning from Mass or the refectory,
as she could not answer for their not being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
insulted should they find themselves in their
way. If the truth be known, we were most
anxious to hoot them, and turn them into derision;
we were even ready to throw water
at them. Meanwhile Madame de la Roche
Aymon was expected to dinner at her
uncle’s, the Cardinal de la Roche Aymon, and
Madame la Duchesse de Chevreuse on her
side was expecting her daughter-in-law,
Madame la Duchesse de Luynes. Their attendants
said they had remained at the Abbaye-aux-Bois.
Accordingly their relations sent
word that they were waiting for them; but
the Lady Abbess wrote to Madame de
Chevreuse, and to the Cardinal, that Mesdames
de Luynes and de la Roche Aymon
were not quite right in their heads, and that
she would hand them over only to their
relations. Madame de Chevreuse, in a state
of anxiety, hurried to the Abbey, when
she soundly rated her daughter-in-law; and
the two prisoners, very much annoyed at
this adventure, were given into her charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“Mademoiselle d’Aumont excused herself
by saying she was not aware that these ladies
were hiding in her room, but there was every
reason to believe she was implicated in the
plot.</p>

<p>“A fine story occurred at another ball.
Mademoiselle de Chevreuse found a note
appointing a meeting, addressed to Madame
la Vicomtesse de Laval, who had been
at the ball and had dropped it. The note
ran as follows: ‘You are adorable, my dear
Vicomtesse; trust in my discretion and
my fidelity. To-morrow at the same hour
and in the same house.’ On finding this note,
Mademoiselle de Chevreuse immediately
read it and put it in her pocket; after the
ball she showed it to all the red class. We
could well imagine that it was a gentleman
who wrote to her like that. The mistresses,
hearing of it, insisted on having the note, and
we believe it must have been returned to
Madame de Laval, as she never came again
to the Convent for any of the carnival balls.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>There was much talk in Paris two years
later concerning an affront sustained by
Madame de Laval. Bachaumont mentions
that Madame de Laval presented herself for
the post of lady-in-waiting to Madame. It
had been almost promised her, but she was
refused it because her father, M. de Boulogne,
had been treasurer in the war department,
and therefore was not of gentle birth. Her
father-in-law, M. de Laval, first gentleman of
the chamber to Monsieur, sent in his resignation.
The whole family of the Montmorency
made an outcry over it.</p>

<p>Madame de Laval was the daughter of M.
de Boulogne, <i>fermier général</i>.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> From the
anecdote related by the young Princess, and
from a certain account given in Lauzun’s
<i>Memoirs</i>, it seems probable that the alleged
motive was only a pretext, in order to avoid
placing in attendance on Madame a person
with such a reputation for heedlessness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sacristy.</span></p>

<p>“After having served three months in the
abbey-house I was sent to the sacristy or
vestry department, where the company was
very amusing. As for the duties, they did
not suit me at all, for I have always had an
incredible aversion to needlework. There
were at that time some very agreeable persons
employed in this department, amongst
others Mademoiselle de Broye and Mademoiselle
de Paroi, with whom I was very
intimate, and Mademoiselle de Durfort, who
was lively and very charming. Mademoiselle
de Paroi was pretty, had a good figure, and
played the harp like an angel; she was twelve
years old. Mademoiselle de Broye, a little
older, was rather pretty, and overflowing with
wit.</p>

<p>“One may well say that all the gossip and
all the news was chronicled in the sacristy.
It was a general meeting-place for the whole
blessed day. If any one was complaining, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
rejoicing, or had some event to relate, it was
always to the sacristy that they came.</p>

<p>“The two vestry nuns were Madame de
Granville and Madame de Tinel. Madame
de Granville wished to teach me to embroider,
for she herself embroidered most beautifully;
but she never succeeded in teaching me. I
therefore did no work, but was employed in
folding and cleaning the vestments, and
helping Madame de Saint Philippe to arrange
the church.</p>

<p>“In the evenings at least twenty persons
came to talk about what had taken place in
the four corners of the establishment; but I
did not remain there, for I used to go to
Madame de Rochechouart’s, where I always
found Madame de Choiseul, Mesdemoiselles
de Conflans, Madame de Sainte Delphine,
Madame de Saint Sulpice, Madame de Saint
Edouard, and the best society. Madame de
Sainte Delphine, sister to Madame de
Rochechouart, was generally stretched out,
with her feet upon a chair, beginning purses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
of which she never finished one; I had
much amusement in listening to her, for she
was very droll; and though Madame de
Rochechouart’s wit was more remarkable and
striking, whereas Madame de Sainte Delphine’s
was often languid like her person, yet when
roused she was very agreeable. Moreover,
it is well known that wit is hereditary in
the Mortemart family. Madame de Sainte
Delphine was one of the prettiest women one
could see; she was twenty-six years old, tall,
with lovely fair hair, large blue eyes, the most
beautiful teeth in the world, charming features,
a fine figure, and a noble carriage. She suffered
a great deal from her chest, was of an
indolent character, and entirely dominated by
her sister.</p>

<p>“Madame de Saint Sulpice was pretty,
lively, and amiable; Madame de Saint Edouard
pretty, amiable, and very romantic. We
talked as freely as we pleased, and whatever
was said, I never saw Madame de Rochechouart
grow warm in discussing any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
opinion. At the very utmost, she would
throw ridicule on the matter—a talent in
which she excelled, and against which it was
difficult to hold one’s own. New works were
read that could without inconvenience be
read by us. We chatted about all that took
place in Paris; for the ladies spent their days
in the parlour, where they received the very
best company, and the young ladies went out
a great deal, so everything was known.</p>

<p>“It was rare at Madame de Rochechouart’s
to hear any one speak ill of their neighbours,
and even then it was always much more
vaguely than in any of the other sets in the
Convent. Yet her circle was the one most
feared, for it was well known that every one
there was witty, and superior to the rest. It
was therefore looked upon as a kind of
tribunal, whose criticism one dreaded to
encounter. When, on leaving Madame de
Rochechouart, I returned to the sacristy,
Madame Saint Mathieu and Madame Sainte
Ursule used to ask me: ‘Well, what do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
those exquisites say about us?’—‘Nothing,
Madame,’ I could honestly reply; ‘they did
not mention you.’ Then their astonishment
was without end, for they themselves
ran down the whole household all day
long. I may say that Madame de Rochechouart,
her sister Madame de Saint
Sulpice, and several other ladies of their
society, had an indifference amounting
to contempt for anything that did not
particularly concern them, and were always
the last to become acquainted with the
news of the Convent.</p>

<p>“It seemed to me that Madame de
Rochechouart and her sister had a style of
their own, and a manner that we all caught;
I mean those of us whom she received.
The women of the world were astonished at
the style in which we expressed ourselves.
Mademoiselle de Conflans, especially, never
said anything like any one else; there was
originality in her every word.”</p>

<p>Madame de Rochechouart’s society, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
advice, full of tact, and refinement that she
gave these young girls, admirably adapted
them for the part they were destined to fill
in the highest ranks of society. In our free
and easy days we cannot have the faintest
conception of what was formerly considered
good style and courteous manners, nor of the
value that was set on all the different shades
of good breeding. “Politeness, good taste,
and style constituted a kind of truce that
each one guarded with care, as if it had
been confided to them only. Women especially
were the chief supporters of this ground-work
of all the charms of society.”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>“I shall never forget what happened one
day between me and Madame de Rochechouart.
She had told me to come to her
cell in the evening. So I went, and found
her surrounded with papers, busily writing.
I was not astonished, as she was in
the habit of being so occupied; but what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
struck me was to see her look disconcerted
and blush tremendously on my arrival. She
told me to take a book and sit down.</p>

<p>“I therefore pretended to read, and
watched her; she wrote with great agitation,
rubbed her forehead, sighed, and looked
around her with a fixed and absent look, as
if her thoughts were a hundred leagues away.</p>

<p>“She often wrote like that for three consecutive
hours; at the slightest sound she
would give a start, which showed how
absorbed she was, and seemed in a way
almost angry at having been disturbed. On
that day I so distinctly saw tears in her eyes
that I could not help thinking that perhaps
she was not happy. While pondering, I
looked at her; she had a paper before her,
her pen in hand, her mouth half open, her
eyes looking fixedly before her, while her
tears were flowing. I was so deeply affected
that tears gathered in my eyes, and I was
unable to suppress a deep sigh; this aroused
Madame de Rochechouart, who raised her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
eyes, and seeing me in tears immediately
concluded I had noticed the state of anxiety
she was in. She held out her hand to me,
in a most expressive and touching manner,
saying, ‘Dear heart, what is the matter?’ I
kissed her hand and burst into tears; she
questioned me again, and I confessed that
the extreme agitation I had seen her in had
led me to suppose that she was harbouring
some sorrow, and that this was the cause of
my being so affected. Then she folded me
in her arms, and remained silent for a time,
as though reflecting on what she would say.
Then she said to me: ‘I was born with a very
vivid imagination, and in order to employ
it, I hurriedly set down on paper all that
it conceives. As among these fancies many
are sad and melancholy, they often affect me
keenly enough to make me shed tears.
Loneliness and a life of contemplation keep
up in me this propensity to give way to
imagination.’ The supper bell rang while
we were still talking. We parted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
regret, and since then Madame de Rochechouart’s
tenderness towards me increased
twofold, and nothing could equal the tender
interest I felt for her in return.”</p>

<p>“About this time I was removed from the
sacristy and put into the record office. I
cried a great deal when I was sent there, for
all the nuns were old grumblers, with the
exception of Madame de la Conception, who
was of the Maillebois family; she had a
dignified manner, and it was easy to see she
was a lady of high birth. She knew everything
connected with the Abbey, and it
was a pleasure to listen to her anecdotes
of former times at the monastery.</p>

<p>“Madame de la Conception had a mania
for singing ballads; I never heard a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
nasal voice. She sang every day to us the
ballads of <i>Judith</i>, of <i>Gabrielle de Vergy</i>, and
many others. Sometimes, to amuse us, she
would show us some curious things, for they
possessed, among the records, letters from
Queen Blanche, from Anne of Brittany, and
from several other Queens of France,
addressed to the Abbesses of the Convent.
Letters from Guy de Laval to his aunt, the
Abbess of the Abbaye-aux-Bois, written when
he was with the army during the disturbances
of Charles the Seventh’s reign; La Hire
and Dunois were mentioned in these letters,
and several other interesting documents she
showed us.</p>

<p>“The pupils at that time on duty at the
record office<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> were Mademoiselle de Caumont,
handsome, witty, but easily offended, aged
thirteen; Mademoiselle d’Armaillé, fourteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
years old, hideous, affected, but a good
creature; Mademoiselle de Saint Chamans,
ugly, with very short legs, quite out of proportion
to her body, eighteen years old;
Mademoiselle de Beaumont, ugly and lame,
but a good soul; Mademoiselle de Sivrac,
nineteen years of age, of noble appearance,
but subject to spasms, and rather crazy;
Mademoiselle de Lévis, kind, colourless, not
clever, fourteen years of age.</p>

<p>“I have already mentioned Madame de
Maillebois; the other nuns at the record office
were: Madame de Saint Romuald, an old
grumpy; Madame de Saint Germain, another
old grumpy; Madame de Saint Pavin, forty-eight
years old, who never spoke, and was
very sly.</p>

<p>“We spent the whole day, Caumont and I,
making fun of all these people. Madame de
Saint Romuald was eighty years old, and
Madame de Saint Germain seventy-five.
They spent the whole day quarrelling, first
about one thing and then about another; it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
was really incredible. They were constantly
making mistakes in their accounts, and always
put the fault on each other. It was comical
to see them, with their spectacles on, buried
up to their noses in the large archive books.
They spent their days reading either the old
letters that former Abbesses of the Abbaye-aux-Bois
had received, or else poring over
the old lawsuits of those ladies, and if ever
any one wished to know anything concerning
the Abbey in former times, they never could
tell a thing.</p>

<p>“On one occasion, Madame de Saint
Romuald had lent a sugar rasp to Madame
de Saint Germain, who either lost it or forgot
she had had it. One Sunday, during
High Mass, Madame de Saint Romuald remembers
her rasp; and as these two centuries
were seated side by side, Madame de Saint
Romuald leans over to Madame de Saint
Germain, and says in a low tone—</p>

<p>“‘By the by, you have not returned me
my rasp?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>“‘What do you mean by your rasp?’</p>

<p>“‘What! I did not lend you my rasp?’</p>

<p>“Madame de Saint Germain (annoyed at
such a request in church)—</p>

<p>“‘I have not got your rasp.’</p>

<p>“The other (getting angry and raising her
voice)—</p>

<p>“‘Give me back my rasp!’</p>

<p>“They continued so long and so loud that
the pupils burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Astonished at this, the Lady Abbess asked
what had taken place; she was told; she
sent word to the two ladies to be quiet, and
she would send them each a rasp.</p>

<p>“When they returned to the office, they
sulked at each other for a whole week, and
whenever sugar or things lent were mentioned,
Madame de Saint Romuald would at
once relate the story of her rasp; how she
had once had one, that she had lent it, and
that it had been lost. Then Madame de
Saint Germain would say that it was not
true; and we often amused ourselves with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
putting the conversation on this subject, so
as to see them quarrel.”</p>

<p>On leaving the record office Hélène went
to the refectory department, where she spent
two months. Her duties there consisted in
waiting on the pupils at table, helping to lay
the cloth, to keep the refectory in order,
and to put away the glass and china, etc.—all
useful acquirements for a future mistress
of a household. However, although so busy
in the refectory, Hélène did not neglect her
accomplishments.</p>

<p>“At that time I danced in the ballets of
<i>Orpheus</i> and <i>Eurydice</i>; we danced them in
our theatre, which was a very fine one, and
handsomely decorated; it was at the end of
the garden, near the old plague-house.</p>

<p>“We were in all fifty-five dancers. Mademoiselle
de Choiseul danced as Orpheus,
Mademoiselle de Damas as Eurydice, I as
Cupid, Mesdemoiselles de Chauvigny and
Montsauge were two attendants. There
were ten dancers of the funeral entry, ten as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
the furies, ten as Orpheus’s followers, ten as
Eurydice’s, and ten for the Court of Love.
That winter we also played <i>Polyeucte</i> in the
Convent theatre. I took the part of Pauline,
Mademoiselle de Châtillon was Polyeucte,
and Mademoiselle de Choiseul, Sévère; it
was a great success. Shortly after they
made us study the <i>Cid</i>. I played Rodriguez,
and also Cornelia, in the <i>Death of Pompey</i>.”</p>

<p>These performances were so full of interest
for the little actresses that they frequently
devoted their recreation hours to
the study of their parts. The audience was
composed of the mothers and relations of the
pupils, and their friends. And these plays
were the talk of all Paris.</p>

<p>However, these worldly amusements did
not interfere with the regular course of their
duties.</p>

<p>“After the refectory,” Hélène tells us, “I
was a fortnight on service at the gate. There
were five of us: Mademoiselle de Morard,
fourteen years old, rather pretty, but stupid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
and insipid; Mademoiselle de Nagu, aged
seventeen, pretty and amiable; Mademoiselle
de Chabrillan, ugly but clever, fourteen years
of age; Mademoiselle de Barbantanne, fifteen
years old, looking like a boy, a romp, pretty,
and a very good dancer.</p>

<p>“Our duty was to accompany the portress
whenever she went to open the outer
gates.</p>

<p>“The movement was perpetual; at one
moment the masters, then the doctors, or
else the directors; in fact, Mesdames de
Fumel and de Pradines, the two portresses,
were completely tired out by the evening;
we did not like the former—she was sour, dry,
and ill-natured.</p>

<p>“The turning box,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> where I was next sent,
suited me better; we saw a number of people
all day long; I was there with Aumont,
Cossé, and Chalais, all very amiable young
ladies.</p>

<p>“The two nuns in charge, Mesdames de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
Calvisson and de Nogaret, were sisters; the
latter was fond of reading, and very learned.</p>

<p>“We had to ring for every one who was
wanted, and there was a different bell for
each person. It was rather difficult not to
make a mistake; for one, there would be
3, 8, and a peal; for another, V, 8, and a
peal; it was endless.</p>

<p>“Aumont was eighteen years old, and was
witty and talented; she was rather pretty, and
had been married some time.</p>

<p>“Cossé was only twelve; she was plain, but
full of charm, and very delicate; she married
later the Duc de Mortemart.</p>

<p>“Madame d’Avaux, of whom I have already
spoken, was good-natured and pretty, but
silly.</p>

<p>“Lastly, Mademoiselle de Chalais, very
pretty, fifteen years old, rather an invalid.</p>

<p>“This department amused us, but as the
work was very fatiguing, no one ever remained
there long.</p>

<p>“From the duties of the tower I passed on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
to those of the community. I could have
spent a long time in this department without
feeling dull if only I had been left there. I
was with Mademoiselle de Talleyrand, who
was pretty, amiable, and very popular, and
Mademoiselle de Périgord, her sister, also
pretty; Mademoiselle de Duras, pretty, and
rather amiable; and finally, Mademoiselle de
Spinola, who was awkward, ill-natured, but
very handsome.</p>

<p>“Among the ladies who attended to these
duties was an old nun named Madame de
Saint Charles; although seventy-five years
old, she was lively, and nothing disturbed
her; we might make any noise around her,
she did not mind it. There were always
about fifty people in the community-room,
busy at all kinds of needlework. Talleyrand
played the harpsichord and I the harp, and
we sang; these concerts greatly amused the
nuns.</p>

<p>“This room was hung all round with full-length
portraits of the Abbesses of the Abbaye-aux-Bois;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
nearly all of them had their coats
of arms painted on an escutcheon at their
feet. In this way one could tell who they
were. Mother Saint Charles told us of an
adventure that occurred during her novitiate,
which I will relate here.</p>

<p>“On one occasion a certain Madame de
Saint Ange came to propose her daughter as
novice to Madame de la Trémouille, at that
time Abbess of the Abbaye-aux-Bois. The
young lady seemed of a gentle disposition,
and, moreover, the mother offered a pension
and dowry suitable for a girl of good family.
She was therefore accepted, and entered the
next day, and soon every one in the Convent
was enchanted with her grace, her wit, and
her gentleness. She was novice together with
several others, including Madame de Saint
Charles, who sometimes said to her: ‘Mademoiselle
de Saint Ange, it is incredible that a
young lady so modest and well-bred as you
are should have the gestures and manners
that you sometimes have; for when you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
standing before the fireplace you spread
your feet in an odd manner, and when you
move up your chair you often seem about to
take hold of it between your knees; in fact,
it is extraordinary to see, in the same person,
an air of modesty verging on constraint, occasionally
combined with the gestures of a
musketeer.’ Mademoiselle de Saint Ange
blushingly replied that she had been brought
up with a brother, whose manners she used
to copy as a child, and that she had never
quite got rid of them.</p>

<p>“One night, during a terrible thunderstorm,
Madame de Saint Charles, who at
that time was Mademoiselle de Ronci, came
and knocked at the cell of Mademoiselle
de Saint Ange, and begged her to open the
door.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Saint Ange kept her
waiting a few moments, and then opened. ‘Ah,’
said Mademoiselle de Ronci, ‘I am horribly
frightened in my cell; you must let me
sleep in yours till the storm is gone by.’ But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
Mademoiselle de Saint Ange would not hear
of it, telling her the holy rules forbade it,
and begged her to go away. At last Mademoiselle
de Ronci, seeing she was determined
not to let her remain in her cell, went away,
highly displeased at this want of good nature.</p>

<p>“When Mademoiselle de Saint Ange had
been doing her novitiate for three months,
her mother came one day to the Lady Abbess,
to say that her daughter felt no longer any
vocation for a religious life, and to beg that
she might be restored to her. Mademoiselle
de Saint Ange departed, to the grief of the
whole Convent, who regretted her very much.
Some days after, Madame de Saint Ange
wrote to the Lady Abbess, to ask her pardon
for the deception she had practised on her.
She informed her that she had had in her
establishment her son instead of her daughter.
The young man having had the misfortune
to kill his adversary in a duel, she
had made him wear his sister’s clothes, and
had put him in the Abbaye-aux-Bois, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
being the only plan she could devise for
sheltering him from the severity of the
law.</p>

<p>“The Lady Abbess replied that since the
thing was done, she congratulated herself
that by this means the life had been saved
of one who, during his stay in her house, had
given her such a good impression of his
character. Madame de Saint Charles told us
that Mademoiselle de Saint Ange would often
inadvertently speak of herself in the masculine
gender.</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">The Library</span>.</p>

<p>“At length I was sent to the library,
to the great satisfaction of Madame de
Mortemart. I was seated quietly reading in
the kitchen when they came to tell me that I
was appointed to the library. I quickly ran
to find Madame de Sainte Delphine; as soon
as she saw me she said: ‘At last you come
to me; I hope we shall spend our lives together.’
Indeed I hardly left her; she was
nearly always at her sister’s and I with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>“She took no more notice of what
happened to the books than if they had not
existed, and yet she was fond of reading;
when she wanted a book she would ask
Madame de Saint Joachim for it.</p>

<p>“Sometimes when she was in the library,
and saw that when books were fetched or
returned Madame de Saint Joachim noted
them down, she would express her astonishment
at so much trouble being taken.</p>

<p>“I spent the morning doing commissions
for her, and generally went to her immediately
after appearing before Madame de
Rochechouart at morning class.</p>

<p>“After going to <i>prime</i><a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> she had gravely
returned to bed, and thought no more of
getting up; when I went in I used to say:
‘Madame, it is half-past eight o’clock.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah, good heavens, is it possible? I cannot
believe it!’</p>

<p>“Sometimes Madame de Rochechouart, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
returning from the schoolroom, would come
into her cell, and say: ‘My sister, it is shameful
for a nun to be still in bed.’ Thereupon
Madame de Sainte Delphine would reply:
‘I have taken no vow not to sleep to my
heart’s content.’ Madame de Rochechouart
would then say: ‘Well, Hélène, you must
make my sister get up.’ I would call Sister
Leonard, then she would close her curtains,
put on her chemise, and dress herself without
doing her hair. She looked charming thus,
when dressed, with her head still bare; she
kept her hair rather long, for fear of catching
cold; it was of the most beautiful colour.
She next washed her head in tepid water,
and put on her guimp and veil. ‘Madame,’
I would say, ‘is there nothing you have forgotten?’—‘No,
nothing to-day.’ But scarcely
had she entered the library<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> when she exclaimed:
‘Hélène, I have forgotten my hand-kerchief.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
I would run to fetch it; sometimes
it was one thing, sometimes another. She
would keep me thus running about all the
morning, but I was so fond of her that I did
not mind it.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Choiseul and her mother—Madame de Stainville’s
romantic adventures—Mademoiselle de Choiseul’s wedding—Taking
the veil.</p>
</div>


<p>“My intimacy with Mademoiselle de Choiseul
increased day by day; we had everything in
common, our books, our trinkets, and even
the keys of our drawers and writing desks,
were mutually in each other’s possession.</p>

<p>“It happened about that time that Mademoiselle
de Lévis<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> one day publicly taunted
Mademoiselle de Choiseul before the whole
class with the fact of her mother’s being kept
in confinement on account of her having been
in love with an actor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>
<p>“Mademoiselle de Choiseul, although very
angry, was not disconcerted, and said: ‘No;
my mother lives in the country because she
prefers it, at least that is what I have always
been told. But if what you say be true, it
will not be the most commendable action on
your part to have enlightened me on the
subject.’</p>

<p>“The whole class was exceedingly irritated
with Mademoiselle de Lévis, and all the
young ladies told her that her conduct was
infamous; that no one could be reproached
for a thing of that kind; that they were in
despair at its having happened in their class;
and that they would ask as a favour for her
removal back into the blue class, in consideration
of her own honour, since the more she
was treated like a child the more excusable
her behaviour would be.</p>

<p>“Then Mademoiselle de Lévis sought out
Mademoiselle de Choiseul, who was in a corner
of the classroom, and being mean-spirited,
knelt down before her and begged her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
not to repeat the story. All the young
ladies of her class followed and hooted her.
Mademoiselle de Choiseul replied aloud:
‘Mademoiselle, all that I can do for you is
not to mention your name, and I give you
my word of honour that it shall not pass my
lips; but I should be condemned for ever in
the eyes of my companions if I appeared
unconcerned after what you have told me in
their presence, and if I did not seek information
about my mother from my relatives.’</p>

<p>“At that moment a mistress, who had
noticed during the last hour the disturbance
amongst the pupils, came forward and
asked what had happened. Mademoiselle
de Choiseul said that she had had a dispute
with one of the pupils, and that it was now
over; the mistress asked if any one had a
complaint to make, and as we remained silent
she returned to her seat.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Choiseul and I afterwards
held a consultation, in order to see what
steps she should take, and we decided that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
she must speak of this event to Madame de
Rochechouart.</p>

<p>“I asked Mademoiselle de Choiseul if she
had had no suspicions of what she had been
taunted with, and she said: ‘No; I fancied
that my mother was a peculiar woman, and
was disliked by her family, and that was her
reason for preferring to live in the country.’
She also added: ‘Neither my father<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> nor my
uncle ever mention her to me, and when occasionally
I have spoken of her, I noticed that
the subject was distasteful; but now that I
recall a host of things said before me, I am
afraid what Mademoiselle de Lévis told me
is true.’ Then she added: ‘I am suffocating,
I feel an imperative need to weep, and am
controlling myself here.’ I went to Mother
Quatre Temps and asked her to allow me to
go to Madame de Rochechouart, as I had
something to say to her, and she gave me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
the permission. Mademoiselle de Choiseul,
on her side, went to ask Madame de Saint
Pierre, who, being very strict, replied that
she might wait to see Madame de Rochechouart
till the names were called over in the
evening.</p>

<p>“Choiseul, who was very quick tempered,
could bear it no longer, and burst into tears.
Madame de Saint Pierre said she was out of
temper, and ordered her to go and kneel
down. She obeyed. All the pupils pitied
her, and made much of her. They told
Lévis that she was the cause of all this
trouble; she had remained in a corner of the
room, not daring to show herself. Mademoiselle
de Choiseul said to me in a low
voice: ‘As you have permission, go to Madame
de Rochechouart, tell her my trouble,
and beg her to send for me; but do not
mention Lévis, as I have promised not to
do so.’</p>

<p>“I therefore ran off to Madame de
Rochechouart. I did not find her in her cell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
but only Madame de Sainte Delphine, who
said to me: ‘Ah! it is you, my pussy. I
am very glad to see you, for I was feeling as
dull as a dog, waiting for my sister. Tell
me something amusing, I beg of you, for I
am in exceedingly low spirits.’</p>

<p>“Then I said to Madame de Sainte
Delphine: ‘Mademoiselle de Choiseul and I
have something to tell Madame de Rochechouart,
but she has not obtained permission
to come; if you would be so kind as to send
for her, by Sister Leonard, saying that
Madame de Rochechouart asks for her, it
would not be a lie, as it is also your name.’
She consented, and shortly after Madame de
Rochechouart came in.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Choiseul arrived at the
same moment, and we told Madame de Rochechouart
what had taken place. She appeared
most indignant. ‘And who said such a
thing?’ she inquired. We absolutely refused
to tell her. Thereupon Madame de Rochechouart,
who did not wish to commit herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
with Mademoiselle de Choiseul, said: ‘I
have withdrawn myself from the world, and
events of this kind do not reach us; but tell
me which member of your family you wish
me to write to, who may be able to give you
some explanations.’ Mademoiselle de Choiseul
named her aunt, the Duchesse de
Gramont.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>“Madame de Rochechouart accordingly
wrote to her: she came the next day, and
Mademoiselle de Choiseul having told her
the cause of her trouble, Madame de Gramont
replied: ‘I do not wish to deceive you; you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
are now growing up and cannot be left in
a state of ignorance that might lead you
to make injudicious remarks. It is quite
true that your mother’s misconduct has
obliged her family to place her in a convent.
You have a sister<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> who has been brought up
in another convent, and who is coming to
be with you at the Abbaye-aux-Bois. Your
demeanour towards the pupils must be
sufficiently authoritative to prevent any one
broaching the subject in future, and above all,
have no confidantes. You can easily imagine
that this is not an agreeable topic of conversation
for your father; do not therefore
mention it to him, unless he be the first to
speak to you.’</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Choiseul asked if she
would not be allowed to write to her mother.
Madame de Gramont said that she could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
take upon herself to give her that permission,
but that she would speak of it to her family.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Choiseul came and told
me all this, and we agreed that we would
appear to have forgotten what had taken
place, and that if the others referred to it
we should show our displeasure.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mademoiselle de Lévis’s
cruel gossip was but too well-founded, and
the romantic adventures of Madame de Stainville,
especially the final catastrophe, had
created a great scandal.</p>

<p>When the Duc de Choiseul became war
minister (at the death of the Maréchal de
Belle-Isle) he had his brother, the Comte
Jacques de Choiseul-Stainville, named lieutenant-general.
The Count had no fortune;
his family, wishing to secure for him a brilliant
match, turned their thoughts to Mademoiselle
Thérèse de Clermont-Revel, who was a
great heiress, and endowed with a charming
presence. The Duke cleverly conducted the
negotiations, and the marriage was decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
upon. The Count was nearly forty years
old, his betrothed was only fifteen, and had
never seen her future husband. He obtained
leave of absence, came to Paris, and <i>six hours
after</i> his arrival the marriage was celebrated.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The young Comtesse de Stainville was
presented in society by her sister-in-law, the
Duchesse de Choiseul, and created quite a
sensation. She danced like an angel, and
shone with grace and beauty. It was easy to
suppose that before long she would receive
attentions from the most fashionable men.
Contemporary memoirs even pretend that her
brother-in-law, the Duc de Choiseul, dared to
hazard a declaration, which was badly received.
It is said that Lauzun fared better, but this
passing fancy was shortly superseded by
another sentiment. It is well known how
actors were then run after in society. Their
conquests were innumerable. At that time
Clairval was the actor most in vogue, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
favourite of all the ladies. He united to
undoubted talent a handsome face, an elegant
figure, and a natural audacity which nothing
could check. He was not long in perceiving
the impression that he had made on Madame
de Stainville, and determined to risk all and
take advantage of it. A lady’s-maid and a
footman were taken into the secret, and
Madame de Stainville even went so far as
to receive Clairval at her own residence.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Some time passed: Madame de Stainville
gave birth to a second daughter, and nothing
foreshadowed the scandal that was about to
take place; but the intimacy between Clairval
and the Countess was gradually becoming
known; the Duchesse de Gramont was the
first to hear of it. She hated her young
sister-in-law, and was not slow to inform her
brother of the rumours which till then he
had ignored.</p>

<p>The Count was away on military service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
with the army, and was to return to be present
at an entertainment in which all Paris was
interested. The Maréchale de Mirepoix was
preparing a wonderful fancy ball at the hôtel
de Brancas. National dances were to be
performed by twenty-four gentlemen and by
as many ladies, in Chinese and Indian
costumes. These were being rehearsed for
the last week. “The guilty and unfortunate
Madame de Stainville,” says Madame du
Deffand, “had Prince d’Hénin for a partner,
and was present every day at these rehearsals.
On Tuesday, two days before the ball, all the
dancers were entertained at a supper given
by the Duchesse de Valentinois; it was
noticed that Madame de Stainville seemed
very dejected and constantly had tears in her
eyes. Her husband had arrived that morning.”
On the following day, Wednesday,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> at three
o’clock in the morning, Madame de Stainville
was carried off in a post-chaise and conducted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
by her husband in person to the Convent of
the <i>Filles de Sainte Marie</i> at Nancy. The
Count had easily obtained a <i>lettre de cachet</i>
through his brother, the Duke, and his wife
was confined for the rest of her life. He
returned her all her fortune, and had a trustee
appointed, who was authorised to give the
Countess everything she required, but not
a farthing in money. A sum was devoted to
his daughters’ maintenance, and the remainder
of her income put under sequestration for
their benefit.</p>

<p>The lady’s-maid was sent to the Salpetrière
and the footman to Bicêtre, as a punishment
for having aided in the affair. It was
generally considered that M. de Stainville
had inflicted on his wife a chastisement of
unheard-of severity. In those days of easy
morality it was not the custom to consider
this sin as an unpardonable offence, and the
beautiful Madame de Stainville excited a
universal feeling of pity. It was even said
that the Count’s mistress, a young and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
charming actress at the opera, notified to him
on his return from Nancy that she would
never see him again, for fear of being taken
for an accomplice in such an iniquitous proceeding.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Some time after this sad revelation, Mademoiselle
de Choiseul, very much agitated, came
to Hélène as she was leaving the parlour, and
said to her: “Fancy, they are going to put
my sister at the Abbaye-aux-Bois, and she
will arrive next Monday. What distresses
me is that she is simply sent to the dormitory,
whilst I have my own apartment. This
difference is certain to make the pupils talk.”</p>

<p>Hélène advised her to say that it had been
considered proper to make this difference on
account of her being the eldest.</p>

<p>“She told me she was to go out the next
day and make her sister’s acquaintance, as
she had never seen her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>
<p>“She went out, accordingly, and as she was
late in returning we were not able to talk
together in private. But in the evening she
came into my room, and told me that her
sister was four years younger than herself,
and a mere child; that she was rather pretty,
but did not appear very lively, and she thought
her ignorant and badly brought up; that she
had made a great deal of her, but that she had
appeared very untamed. She also told me
that she was called Mademoiselle de Stainville.
We decided to notice her a great deal,
in order that no unpleasantness should occur
when she was received.”</p>

<p>She was brought to the Convent by Madame
la Duchesse de Choiseul, who gave instructions
that she should be appealed to for all requirements,
being specially in charge, instead of
her father or the Duchesse de Gramont, as
was the case for Mademoiselle de Choiseul.
It is evident that the kindness of the
Duchesse de Choiseul did not belie itself, and
that she was determined to act the part of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
mother to the forsaken child, whom every
one seemed to repel.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Choiseul presented her
to the class, saying that she was her sister,
and that she begged every one to behave
kindly towards her. Then Mesdemoiselles
de Conflans, Mademoiselle de Damas, and
myself, went up to her, and made a great
deal of her, but she was very shy, and
received us very coldly.</p>

<p>“As soon as she had made some acquaintances,
Choiseul left her, and never became
very intimate with her, for there was a great
difference between the two sisters.</p>

<p>“When the Duc de Choiseul, Madame de
Stainville, and Madame la Duchesse de
Gramont came to see Mademoiselle de
Choiseul, they never asked for Mademoiselle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
de Stainville; but Mademoiselle de Choiseul
insisted, and said she would not go
down to the parlour if her sister was not also
asked for; so they were obliged to see
Mademoiselle de Stainville. It was the
same thing about going out. Mademoiselle
de Choiseul would never go by herself to
the hôtel de Choiseul;<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and all this was
from a generous and kindly feeling, as she
did not care for her sister, but she would not
allow herself any distinction which might be
to her disadvantage.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Choiseul’s generous conduct
under these circumstances proves a
nobility of character most uncommon in a
child of fourteen. No doubt the exalted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
opinion these young girls had of their rank
and their birth contributed to develop sentiments
of honour and refinement: they
practised the axiom <i>noblesse oblige</i> to the full
extent, and to say that they had a base mind
was to them the bitterest reproach. But,
at the same time, it must be acknowledged
that they had the greatest contempt for
any one who did not belong to their caste.
Hélène expresses herself on this point in
the most ingenuous manner.</p>

<p>“At one time,” she tells us, “there was a
breach in the walls of the Convent, while the
garden wall was being rebuilt. It is the
custom, whenever there is a breach in the
enclosure, for the rules of seclusion to be set
aside for as long a time as the breach lasts.
This wall separated the Convent on one
side from the street, whilst on the other side
lay the Convent of the <i>Petites Cordelierès</i>, so
that now, there being a way open, the nuns
were able to visit each other.</p>

<p>“The Convent of the <i>Petites Cordelierès</i> was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
neither as large nor as fine a building as ours.
They only received about thirty pupils, but
they were not young ladies of good birth, and
they were very much embarrassed when they
saw our numerous classes entirely composed
of the daughters of the best families of
France.</p>

<p>“At that time, on returning to the Convent
one evening, Mademoiselle de Choiseul
said she had a great event to tell me. She
said she was going to marry the son of
M. de Choiseul-La-Baume, who was only
seventeen years old,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> that he was very nice,
that she would become the Duchesse de
Choiseul-Stainville, and that the next day
her family were coming to inform Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
de Rochechouart and the Lady Abbess of the
match, and she begged me to accompany her
on her visits.”</p>

<p>It was a time-honoured custom at the
Abbaye-aux-Bois for the young girls personally
to inform their companions of their
marriage, and on this important occasion the
betrothed was accompanied by her greatest
friend. Hélène, delighted at playing such
an important part, prepared herself to escort
Mademoiselle de Choiseul with due solemnity
the following afternoon.</p>

<p>“The next day, accordingly, in the morning,
the Duc and Duchesse de Choiseul, Madame
de Gramont, and M. de Stainville came to the
Lady Abbess’s parlour, and Madame de
Rochechouart also came. They said that the
settlements were to be signed at Versailles
on the following Sunday; that on Monday
the family and friends would sign them; that
on Tuesday Mademoiselle de Choiseul would
receive her wedding-gifts; and that on
Wednesday she would leave for Chanteloup,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span><a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
where the marriage ceremony would take
place; and that two days after she would be
brought back to the Abbaye-aux-Bois, as she
was only fourteen years of age. Directly her
family had left I went with Mademoiselle
de Choiseul all through the establishment, in
order to announce her marriage. On Monday,
the day on which the contract was signed, the
whole class were looking out of the windows
to see M. de Choiseul arrive, and he appeared
to us very good-looking. All Paris was at
the signing of the settlements. On leaving
the parlour, Mademoiselle de Choiseul came
to the window where the other pupils were,
and M. de Choiseul on seeing her made her
a low bow, which delighted us. She told us
that her mother-in-law appeared very strict,
and that it was said she was most difficult
to get on with. The next day she received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
a magnificent wedding-casket, bought at
Mademoiselle Bertin’s, a case of beautiful
diamonds, jewels in blue enamelling, and a
purse containing two hundred louis.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>“On the day of her departure Madame de
Rochechouart allowed me to go out and
breakfast with Madame la Duchesse de
Gramont. Madame de Clermont brought
me back.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Choiseul gave me a
keepsake made of gold and ornamented with
hair, a bag, and a fan. She distributed forty
bags and forty fans among the pupils.</p>

<p>“It had been proposed that her sister should
not go to Chanteloup, but Mademoiselle de
Choiseul complained so bitterly that Madame
la Duchesse consented at last to take her.
She gave her sister a beautiful diamond
locket, and M. de Choiseul gave her a keepsake
also mounted in diamonds.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle de Choiseul, whom I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
call Madame for the future, came back at the
end of a fortnight. She told me all about the
festivities given in her honour, but added that
her mother-in-law had not let a single day
pass without scolding her; as for her husband,
she said she was madly in love with him,
that he was lively and amusing, and that
although they had never been left alone
together he had managed to say a great
many things to her, but that she had scruples
about repeating them to me.”</p>

<p>An event took place at this time which
created a great impression on the young
pupils at the Abbaye-aux-Bois. They were
accustomed to be present at the ceremony of
taking the veil, which was rather a frequent
occurrence in the Convent. It seemed quite
natural to them, and did not excite any
painful emotion. This time, however, it was
different.</p>

<p>“There had been for two years at the
novitiate a young lady called Mademoiselle
de Rastignac, who was twenty years of age.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
She appeared absorbed in the deepest melancholy,
was constantly ill, and spent most of
her time in the infirmary. She had already
adopted the nun’s habit; and twice had been
on the point of pronouncing her vows, but
each time she fell ill, and the ceremony had
to be put off. Her director, Dom Thémines,
urged the indefinite postponement of her vows,
and it was rumoured that she was being made
a nun against her will. Once we spoke to
Madame de Rochechouart about it, and she
replied that she did not interfere in any way
with the novices; but that if she thought she
was being made to embrace a monastic life
against her will she would not give her vote.
Two or three times she was sent back to her
family, so as to bring her once more into
contact with the world, but in vain. At last
a day was fixed for the final ceremony to take
place, and it was said that although she was
very ill, and could hardly stand, she wished
to pronounce her vows.</p>

<p>“On the day of her initiation all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
Hauteforts in the world filled the church, for
she was their near relative. Mademoiselle de
Guignes carried the wax taper and acted as
her godmother; the Comte d’Hautefort was
her squire. She was very pretty. First she
went to the outer church and knelt down on
a praying chair. Her dress was white crape,
embroidered with silver and covered with
diamonds. She bore up very well during the
address from the Abbé de Marolle, in which
he told her it was a great merit in the sight
of God to renounce the world, when one
was made to be loved and be the charm
and ornament of society. It seemed as if he
took pleasure in painting a glowing picture of
all that she was going to give up; but she
bore it with a firm countenance.</p>

<p>“After the address the Comte d’Hautefort
took her hand and led her to the cloister door.
As soon as she had entered it was closed upon
her with a great crash—it is a way they have
on these occasions. We all remarked that
she turned very pale. She entered the court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
more dead than alive. It was said that she
was ill, but it seemed to us as if her mind
suffered more than her body. When she
reached the choir gates they were closed,
while she was undressed and her worldly ornaments
taken from her. She had long fair
hair; when it was let down we were all on the
point of crying out to prevent its being cut
off, and all the pupils exclaimed under their
breath, ‘What a pity!’ At the moment when
the mistress of the novices put her scissors to
it she gave a start. They laid her hair on a
large silver platter; it was lovely. Then
they clothed her in the dress of the order, put
on the veil, and a wreath of white roses, after
which the grating was opened, and she was
presented to the priest, who blessed her.</p>

<p>“An arm-chair was then placed near the
grating for the Lady Abbess, who seated
herself, with her cross-bearer and her chaplain
on either side. Mademoiselle de Rastignac
knelt down before her, and put her hands in
hers. The formula used on taking the vows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
is as follows: ‘I take the vow before God, and
at your hands, Madame, of poverty, humility,
obedience, chastity, and perpetual reclusion,
according to the rule of Saint Benoit, as
observed by Saint Bernard, in the order of
Cîteaux and the affiliation of Clairvaux.’ She
was so weak that she could hardly support
herself on her knees. The mistresses of the
novices, Madame de Saint Vincent and
Madame Saint Guillaume, were behind her.
She seemed to have a veil over her eyes, and
hardly to know where she was; Madame de
Saint Vincent said the words of the vow, and
she repeated them after her. When she had
pronounced the vow of obedience and came
to the vow of chastity, she made so long a
pause that all the pupils, who till then had
been crying, could hardly refrain from laughing.
She looked on every side, as if for
help, so at last the mistress approached her
and said: ‘Come, take courage, my child;
accomplish your sacrifice!’ She gave a deep
sigh at the words ‘of chastity and perpetual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
reclusion,’ and at the same moment her head
drooped on the knees of the Lady Abbess.
It was seen that she had fainted, and she was
taken to the sacristy.</p>

<p>“It is the custom that, after pronouncing
her vows, she should go and kiss the knees
of all the nuns, and embrace the pupils. But
it was said she was not well enough, and that
she would only come and prostrate herself in
the centre of the choir. Nothing has ever
affected me more than seeing her appear at
the door of the sacristy, pale as death, her
eyes dim, and supported by two nuns.
Mademoiselle de Guignes, who carried her
taper, was trembling so violently that
she could scarcely walk. Madame Sainte
Madeleine, for that was the name Mademoiselle
de Rastignac had taken, advanced
to the centre of the choir, where they helped
her to prostrate herself. She was covered
with the pall; the <i>Miserere</i> of La Lande was
sung. We also sang it, as well as the <i>Dies
Iræ</i> and the <i>Libera</i> of the <i>Cordeliers</i>, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
is beautiful. It took altogether an hour and
a half, as the prayers for the dead were said
over her, to remind her that she was dead
to the world. The same evening she had an
attack of fever, and was taken to the infirmary,
where she remained for six weeks. When
she left it she was appointed to the refectory,
but she has not recovered her health. She
remains in a state of languor which causes
everybody to take an interest in her, and
each one seeks to cheer her, trying to make
her life as agreeable as possible.”</p>

<p>Madame d’Orléans, Abbess of Chelles—A visit from the Archbishop—The

</div>


<p>In the extensive building of the Abbaye-aux-Bois
there was one apartment which was
rarely opened. It had formerly been occupied
by Madame d’Orléans, better known under
the name of the Abbess of Chelles.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> From
her youth she had been destined to the
cloister, which certainly was not her vocation.
After a short novitiate she pronounced her
vows, and was named Abbess of the Abbaye-aux-Bois.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
Her remarkable beauty recalled that
of her grandmother, Madame de Montespan,
but her haughty and violent temper and ungovernable
passions soon made her the terror
and shame of the Convent, and at the time
that Hélène was writing the end of her
<i>Memoirs</i> Madame d’Orleáns’ apartment was
still a source of dread to the pupils.</p>

<p>“It was asserted,” says Hélène, “that
shrieks and sounds of beating, and the rattle
of chains, could be heard in the Orléans’
apartment, and it was said that Madame
d’Orléans’ soul came back there in order to
expiate all the evil she had done during her
lifetime.</p>

<p>“People were so afraid of these rooms that
they never entered them except a number at
a time; and Sister Huon, having once gone
in alone to sweep, found marks of blood in
the bedroom, and was nearly suffocated by a
strong smell of sulphur. She immediately
fetched some of the others, but they saw
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>“When this apartment has to be cleaned,
which is only twice a year, for no one ever
occupies it, five or six people go in at the
same time to sweep. There are I know
not how many rooms of an immense size,
all opening into each other, and it is dangerous
to be there alone. The apartment is only
opened for strangers, to show them the
ceilings, which are beautifully painted, and
the magnificent high warp tapestry on
the walls, representing the histories of
Esther and Judith. It is said that these
tapestries are the finest the Gobelin manufactory
have ever produced.”</p>

<p>Madame d’Orléans had left cruel memories
of her stay at the Abbaye-aux-Bois.</p>

<p>“It was said,” continues the young Princess,
“that in the time of Madame d’Orléans, who
was a monster of cruelty, she had caused
some of the nuns to be nearly beaten to
death; others she had had shut up; and
sometimes she made them chant the services
the whole night through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>“Meanwhile M. le Régent would come to
her rooms, and she would spend the night in
laughing and amusing herself, eating and perpetrating
all sorts of follies before the young
nuns she had chosen as her companions.
She said that she made the ladies spend
their nights in prayer in order to expiate the
sins she committed. It is also said that she
used to take off all her clothes, and send for
the nuns to admire her, for she was the most
beautiful woman of her time. She took baths
of milk, and the next day had it distributed
among her nuns at the refectory, ordering
them by their vows of obedience to drink it.</p>

<p>“At last her excesses reached such a point
that the nuns made a formal complaint, and
they were told she would be transferred to
the Abbaye of Chelles.</p>

<p>“M. le Régent came himself to bring her
the king’s commands, and told her that ‘she
had so persecuted her unfortunate nuns that
their complaints had reached the ear of the
king; and that, notwithstanding his tenderness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
for her, he felt compelled to move her to
another abbey, for the public feeling would
be aroused if he did not do justice to these
ladies.’ Then Madame d’Orléans was in
despair; she wept, she implored her father
to let her remain at the Abbaye-aux-Bois, and
promised that henceforth her rule should be
as gentle as it had hitherto been cruel and
despotic. But the Regent was inexorable,
and told her she must be ready to leave for
Chelles in a few days. When she saw that
she could not win him over, she called the
Chapter together, and going down on her
knees before the nuns, entreated them to
petition Government in her behalf, promising
them that they should never again have
to complain of her conduct.</p>

<p>“The Prioress at that time was a Madame
de Noailles. She came forward and said
these words, which have been repeated to
us a hundred times: ‘We have borne without
murmuring, Madame, the cruel penalties you
indicted upon us. Blindly submissive to your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
will, we only saw in our sufferings the hand
of God laid heavily upon us. The respect
which we have for you, and our attachment
to the family you belong to, make us feel
that it is a great misfortune not to end our
days under your rule. But, in the same way
that we should have been to blame had we
refused to accept the afflictions God sent us,
so likewise it would be tempting Providence
if we sought the storm when it pleases Him
to restore us to peace. We trust that you
will find happiness where you are destined to
live, and this, Madame, will be the object of
our prayers and supplications.’</p>

<p>“Madame d’Orléans, seeing by this speech
and the attitude of the nuns that she had
nothing to hope for from them, got up like a
fury and returned to her rooms.</p>

<p>“A few days later M. de la Tourdonnet,
secretary for the commands of the Regent,
and Madame la Duchesse de Villequier, came
to tell her that her father’s carriages were
ready, and that she must leave for Chelles;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
but she declared she would not go. In
vain Madame la Duchesse de Villequier tried
every form of persuasion, she could not prevail
on her to leave. So they returned to
M. le Régent, who said ‘that when gentle
measures failed, strong ones must be used.’
He then sent with M. de la Tourdonnet and
Madame de Villequier his captain of the
guards, M. de Lyonne, and two officers;
and Madame d’Orléans was informed that
these persons had orders to put her in the
carriage. When she heard this, she completely
undressed herself, got into bed, sent
for M. de Lyonne, and asked who would be
bold enough to lay hands on a daughter of
the royal blood of France. M. de Lyonne,
much embarrassed, returned to M. le Régent,
who sent Madame la Princesse de Conti with
orders to try and call his daughter to reason,
and if she did not succeed to have her
wrapped up in her mattresses and carried
away. So Madame la Princesse de Conti
came, and by tears and entreaties at length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
prevailed on her to leave. She was conducted
to Chelles, a distance of four leagues
from Paris, where she retained the title of
Lady Abbess, but without any authority.
Some time after, the Abbey of Saint
Anthony of Paris becoming vacant, she
asked for it, and it was granted to her, but
under the same conditions, namely, that she
should have merely an honorary title. She
died a few years later, and asked to be buried
at the Abbaye-aux-Bois, which request was
granted. Her body lies in the choir, under
a mausoleum of white marble.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>“There was in the Abbaye-aux-Bois, over
the fireplace in the Community Hall, a very
fine portrait of Madame d’Orléans. She was
represented standing, with crowns and sceptres
trampled beneath her feet; in one hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
holding a crucifix, and with the other taking
from an altar a crown of thorns. A peculiarity
of this picture was, that though she was
dressed as a nun, her feet were bare.”</p>

<p>It hardly seems likely that the Abbess
of Chelles would have busied herself with
theological discussions. She, however, professed
very decided Jansenist opinions. Her
father the Regent strongly supported the
Jansenists, out of opposition to the Court
party, who belonged to the opposite sect;
he probably inculcated his ideas to his
daughter, and either under the influence of
their Abbess, or that of their directors, the
Abbaye-aux-Bois had become entirely Jansenist.
The nuns expressed their opinions
so openly that the Convent was put under
an interdict during the last years of Madame
de Richelieu’s rule. However, they got
back into favour, and Monseigneur de Beaumont,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
who was the avowed enemy of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
Jansenists, consented to give confirmation to
the young pupils of the Abbaye-aux-Bois in
the year 1777. Hélène gives a faithful
account of this event, which agitated the
whole Convent, and not one detail of which
escapes her keen observation.</p>

<p>“I was at that time being prepared for
my confirmation, for I was to be confirmed at
Whitsuntide.</p>

<p>“His Grace the Archbishop was to come
that day, and as Mother Quatre Temps was
supposed to be very Jansenist, I bethought
myself to say, in order to please her, that I
feared his Grace the Archbishop, instead of
confirming me in the Holy Spirit, would
confirm me in the evil one. Instead of
scolding me, Mother Quatre Temps laughed
extremely at this joke, and, delighted at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
having said such a witty thing, I went and
repeated it all over the house. Mother
Saint Ambrose, regent of the abbey-house,
held very strong Molinist opinions, and when
my joke came to her ears she complained to
Madame de Rochechouart, who sent for me
and rated me soundly. She decided that I
should not be confirmed then, and I was only
confirmed the following year. I took at my
confirmation the names of Alexandrienne-Emanuelle.
On Whitsunday, after having
officiated at Mass and confirmed the pupils,
His Grace the Archbishop entered the
Abbey. The Lady Abbess, with her crozier
and all the community, received him at the
gate, and he visited all the establishment,
even the schoolrooms. It is the custom for
all the nuns to come forward, one after the
other, and kiss his episcopal ring, but many of
them avoided doing so. I even saw several,
who, carried away by party feeling, stood behind
his back and put out their tongues at him.
He went into the library, which is very fine;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
it consists of three rooms opening into each
other containing thirty thousand volumes,
and some very curious manuscripts. It is
said that the nuns possess Jansenius’s writings
in the original edition, but they are not in
the library, and are no doubt carefully
concealed. When his Grace the Archbishop
came to the library he sat down. Madame
Sainte Delphine, who was head librarian, did
the honours of the place. He was shown
some handsome books, bound in vellum and
ornamented with miniatures. He saw that
some of the presses had their curtains drawn,
and inquired what was in them. He was
told that they contained romances and books
on literature. He desired to see them, so
the presses were opened and he admired the
beauty of the editions, amongst others <i>The
Romance of the Rose</i> and the <i>Holy Grail</i>,
which had magnificent miniatures. He
asked how it came that books of that kind
formed part of a convent library, for they had
certainly not been purchased. Then Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
Sainte Delphine replied that formerly a great
many people had on their death bequeathed
their libraries to the Convent; that Madame
d’Orléans had for her part given hers, which
contained a great many books of this kind.
Passing on to the shelves where the works of
Nicole, Arnaud, Pascal, and other Fathers of
Port Royal were ranged, the Archbishop said:
‘These have turned many a brain, and will
turn many more.’ On passing the division
containing the works of the Fathers of the
Church, he remarked that many shelves were
empty, and asked the reason. Madame
Sainte Delphine said that several of the
ladies had got the books. He expressed his
surprise that women should take pleasure in
reading scholastic works written in Latin,
and said: ‘I am not astonished at my
curates telling me that they are a better
match for the doctors of the Sorbonne than
for the ladies of the Abbaye-aux-Bois.’ He
asked laughingly where Jansenius and the
writings of Father Quesnel were usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
kept. Madame Sainte Delphine replied that
those books were not in the catalogue which
was under her charge.</p>

<p>“Then he inquired whether she had ever
seen these works in the house. She replied
that for some years past they had been so
questioned about this Jansenius that, even if
they had not possessed his works, they would
have tried to procure them, as it is against
all conscience to speak evil of a person unless
you are certain that he deserves it; and that
it could only be the obligation under which
they were to answer questions which made
them read works so far from entertaining as
those of Jansenius. After this the Archbishop
left. Two days later he sent his curates,
who had all the theological books returned to
the library, locked up the shelves, and sealed
them with the Archbishop’s seal, which the
ladies were forbidden to remove. The ladies
then said that in the interior of their establishment
they recognised no authority but that
of the Abbot of Cîteaux or Clairvaux, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
superior. They wrote to him on the subject;
he immediately sent two visitors of the order,
who complained to his Grace the Archbishop,
telling him that his authority could only be
exercised with regard to the steps the nuns
might take outside their Convent, but that
the interior was under the sole jurisdiction of
Cîteaux or Clairvaux.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> As his Grace the
Archbishop was afraid the affair might be
brought before Parliament, he sent to remove
the seals; then the visitors assembled
the Chapter. I do not know what took place;
I only know that when they separated they
left the Abbey as well pleased with the
nuns as the nuns were with them. Shortly
after the Abbot of Clairvaux sent an immense
quantity of Burgundy wine as a present
to the Convent.</p>

<p>“We resolved at that time to give a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
performance in honour of Madame de Rochechouart,
on her fête or Saint’s Day, which
was the 15th of August, Mary being her
name. We wanted to get it up with more
care than usual, so that it might be a success.
So we acted <i>Esther</i>. I took that part.
Mademoiselle de Choiseul was Mordecai,
Mademoiselle de Châtillon Ahasuerus, and
Mademoiselle de Chauvigny was Haman.
Our costumes were copied from those of the
<i>Comédie Française</i>. I had a white and silver
dress, the skirt of which was fastened with
diamonds from top to bottom; I had on more
than one hundred thousand écus’<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> worth
of diamonds, having all those of Mesdames
de Mortemart, de Gramont, and of Madame
la Duchesse de Choiseul. It was the
Vicomtesse de Laval who dressed me. I
had a mantle of pale blue velvet and a gold
crown. All the pupils in the chorus had
white muslin dresses and veils. Before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
play, still wearing the simple costume of the
Convent, I advanced and pronounced the
following words:—</p>

<p>“I cried towards the end, and Madame de
Rochechouart also. The chorus was sung
and a ballet was danced while I dressed.
After the performance, as soon as she saw me,
Madame de Rochechouart held out her arms
to me; I rushed into them, and she folded
me to her heart. She did not hide her great
partiality for me.</p>

<p>“I was so happy at that time that I should
have been glad for it to last for ever. I had
at last been appointed to the dispensary,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
which had been the summit of my ambition,
and I lived there very pleasantly. I was
with Madame de Choiseul, Mesdemoiselles
de Conflans, Mademoiselle de Montsauge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
and Mademoiselle de Damas, all of whom
were pretty and amiable.</p>

<p>“Among the nuns Madame de Saint Côme
was a person of rare amiability; Madame de
Saint Laurent, who was of the Cossé family,
was witty and scatterbrained. Madame
Sainte Marguerite, who was only sixteen years
old, had just taken her vows, and thought only
of amusing herself. Madame Sainte Véronique
was a ridiculous old woman, without a particle
of common sense, and that in itself was a
source of amusement. Madame de Saint
Côme taught us botany; she taught us to know
all the different plants and their virtues. In
the evening we went to Madame de Rochechouart’s.
I would have liked to have spent
my life in that way.</p>

<p>“I have said that there were six of us in
the dispensary. Here are our portraits, all
faithful likenesses: Madame la Duchesse de
Choiseul, fifteen years old, married, pretty,
amiable, bright, witty, but satirical, violent,
and hot-tempered. Mademoiselle Hélène<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
Massalska (myself), fourteen years old, pretty,
clever, graceful, stylish, a good figure, as
stubborn as the Pope’s mule, and incapable
of controlling her first impulse. Mademoiselle
de Damas,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> pretty, most graceful, but with
more jargon than wit, sixteen years of age.
Mademoiselle de Montsauge, the most beautiful
eyes in the world, but with a dark
complexion, gentle, witty, fifteen years
old. Mademoiselle de Conflans,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> rather
pretty, remarkably brilliant and full of wit,
aged fifteen. Her sister, Mademoiselle de
Vaudreuil, was not pretty; she tried to
copy her sister, but was far from being so
clever.</p>

<p>“One morning, Madame de Rochechouart
said to me: ‘Hélène, come to me at six
o’clock; I want to speak to you.’ I went therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
according to the order I had received;
but she only said to me: ‘My dear child, I
am very sorry, but I cannot talk to you now;
my head is burning, and I feel feverish; you
must go away, and I must go to bed.’ I returned
to the dispensary, which was my department,
and said that I had found Madame de
Rochechouart ill. As this was very seldom
the case with her, Madame de Ferrière and
Madame de Cossé, the second and third dispensary
nuns, went to her immediately. When
Madame de Ferrière returned she told us she
had found Madame de Rochechouart in a
high fever. We were all seized with the
greatest apprehension; on going to the
refectory we carried the news to all the
class, and the consternation was general.
After supper Sister Léonard, who waited on
Madame de Rochechouart, came with a message
from her to say our names would not
be called over; and we went sorrowfully to
bed. The next day, on going down to the
schoolroom, we were told that the fever had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
increased, and that Madame de Rochechouart
was going to be taken to the infirmary.
Then we all burst into tears; Madame de
Choiseul, Mesdemoiselles de Conflans, myself,
and a few others were in dreadful grief. The
Duchesse de Mortemart<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> came in the afternoon,
bringing with her Bouvart<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and Lorry.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
The same evening Madame de Rochechouart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
became delirious, and remained in that state
till the eve of her death.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, the masters were dismissed,
we left off playing at any games, and were in
a state of utter despair. Every hour one of
the pupils went to ask for news at the
infirmary. The Lady Abbess went herself
every day to see her. The Duc de
Mortemart and his brother were admitted.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
The Duchesse de Mortemart remained day
and night by her beside. Mademoiselle de
Mortemart seemed sad, but less afflicted than
we were: it is true that her aunt had never
cared much for her. At last, after eleven
days of continuous fever, the doctors declared
that she could not recover, and that
the Sacraments must be administered as soon
as she should become conscious.</p>

<p>“The following day, the twelfth of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
illness, towards the morning, she appeared to
recover consciousness. She was asked, by way
of precaution, if she would not receive the
Sacraments, and she made a sign of assent.
They were therefore administered, and although
it is the custom for the pupils to assist at
these ceremonies from the passage of the infirmary,
as it was feared that our cries might
be heard from her room, and that some of us
might try to see her, we were conducted
during that time to the choir.</p>

<p>“At night her agony began; but they did
not toll the bell, as is customary at such moments,
partly because of the pupils, and also
on account of Madame Sainte Delphine, who
had fallen into a state of stupor. From the
moment she had seen her sister’s illness take
a fatal turn she had not left the foot of her
bed, but after the Sacraments had been administered,
the Duchesse de Mortemart conferred
in a low voice with the Lady Abbess, and
told Madame Sainte Delphine that she begged
her not to spend the night in the infirmary.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
The Lady Abbess told her she insisted on
her going, and gave orders to Madame Saint
Sulpice not to leave her. So she was taken to
the dispensary, where we all, belonging to
that department, spent the night in weeping.</p>

<p>“The Lady Abbess was informed, as she
requested, that Madame de Rochechouart
was at the point of death. Her confessor,
Dom Thémines, had not left her side. The
Duchesse de Mortemart was in the Abbess’s
rooms, for she would not leave the Convent.
When they came to call the Lady Abbess
she begged to go with her, but the Lady
Abbess implored her not to come, and she
sent word to the Duc de Mortemart to come
immediately. He arrived, having on the
previous day asked for a permission from
his Grace the Archbishop to take Madame
Sainte Delphine away from the Convent if
her sister died. At about eight o’clock in the
morning Madame de Rochechouart, who had
not spoken a word since the Sacraments
had been administered, asked for her sister.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
They told her that she was not there, but
that they would fetch her.</p>

<p>“‘Raise my pillows,’ she said. Madame de
Verrue and Madame de Domangeville, first
and second infirmary nuns, did so; then she
took hold of Madame de Verrue’s arm, and
said: ‘Oh, what pain! I am dying!’ and she
expired. The class had just come down, and
Madame de Royer had said that Madame de
Rochechouart was not dead, so that we did
not know but what there might still be hope.
As soon as she had expired, the Lady Abbess
left the infirmary, in order to convey the intelligence
to Madame la Duchesse and her
son. The Duchess fainted away. When she
came to herself again they said there was
nothing else to do but to put Madame Sainte
Delphine in a carriage and take her away.
So a carriage with six horses was sent for;
when it arrived, Madame de Mortemart went
to the dispensary, where Madame Sainte
Delphine had remained, as yet unconscious of
her sister’s death. Madame de Mortemart told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
her nothing, but simply gave her the Archbishop’s
permit to remain three months out
of the Convent. Madame Sainte Delphine
immediately understood what that meant, and
had a violent attack of hysterics. At last
they managed to put her into the carriage,
and convey her into the country at Everli,
where she spent one month. The other two
she spent at Paraclet, with her sister, and
then returned to the Abbaye-aux-Bois.</p>

<p>“The Lady Abbess sent Madame de
Villiers with orders to Madame de Royer to
announce the news to the pupils, but we
already suspected it. She came forward,
when each of us had taken our places, and
said: ‘Young ladies, it has pleased God to
recall to Himself our beloved Madame de
Rochechouart. Offer up to Him the sacrifice
of your legitimate grief, and pray for the
repose of her soul.’ Then we asked to be
taken to the choir, where we recited the
prayers for the dead.</p>

<p>“We had been so deeply attached to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
person of Madame de Rochechouart that we
obtained permission not to appear in the
schoolroom either that day or the next, on
which she was to be buried.</p>

<p>“The class did not follow her funeral, but
passed the time in prayer. She was to have
been buried in the cloister, as all the nuns
are, but the family requested that the body
should be placed in one of the chapels of the
choir, which was accordingly done. A slab
of black marble covers her tomb. Each
pupil had two Masses said for her soul, and
she had a magnificent funeral at the expense
of her family.</p>

<p>“It now became necessary to elect another
mistress-general, but nobody wished to take
the office, each one dreading the comparisons
which would be made by the pupils. Some
of them wished to have Madame de Royer,
but she would not accept. We wanted
Madame Sainte Delphine, but she was
certainly not equal to the work; she was far
too indolent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>“At last, on the day fixed for the meeting
of the Chapter to decide on the appointment,
a novice came at three o’clock from the
community, to tell the class that the ladies
begged us to pray that the light of the Holy
Ghost might guide them in the choice they
were about to make of a mistress-general.
We immediately all knelt down, and after a
short silence sang the <i>Veni Creator</i>.</p>

<p>“At six o’clock the Lady Abbess came to the
schoolroom; we placed ourselves in our stalls,
and she addressed us as follows: ‘Young
ladies, I have come to express to you my
grief at the loss we have sustained, and at
the same time inform you that the ladies
have endeavoured to retrieve it as far as in
them lay. They have elected Madame de
Voyers, second mistress of the novices, in the
place of Madame de Rochechouart.’ We
made no reply to the Lady Abbess, but
merely bowed, and she left the room.</p>

<p>“Shortly after Madame de Voyers, conducted
by Madame de Royer, came in; she had a fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
figure, and enjoyed much consideration in the
novitiate. She was about forty years of age.
She said: ‘Young ladies, I feel that my presence
here can hardly be agreeable to you. I
know how difficult is the task that lies before
me. I pray you to make it easier by placing
your confidence in me. The regrets that
you rightly accord to the memory of Madame
de Rochechouart are a credit both to you and
to her; I cannot flatter myself that I shall
worthily replace her, but I ask you to rest
assured that I shall make every effort to do so.’</p>

<p>“This little speech, made with much sincerity
of manner, touched us; we applauded
vehemently, and asked permission to kiss her
hand. She begged us to embrace her, and
on the following day everything resumed
its usual course.</p>

<p>“For my own part, I never loved her, and
in truth I was to blame, for she deserved
our affection. Madame de Rochechouart’s
death was the cause of my first wish to leave
the Convent.”</p>

August 1698, died the 20th February 1743. She was eighteen

one-and-twenty when made Abbess of Chelles. (<i>Vide</i> the

<p><a id="Footnote_78" href="#FNanchor_78" class="label">[78]</a> Hélène’s account differs from that of Madame, the Regent’s
mother. She was fond of her grand-daughter, and does not
describe her in such dark colours. She never mentions her stay at
the Abbaye-aux-Bois, and only speaks of her installation at Chelles.
The perfect accuracy of those portions of Hélène’s narrative which
we have been able to verify gives great weight to her account of
the facts.</p>

Jansenists was so harsh and even sometimes so violent, was admirable
in private life for his gentleness, his equanimity of character,
and for his liberality. Born the 26th July 1703 in the Château de

Grimm, “a legalised assassin in the streets of Paris, is only too glad,

some little criminal cases against them. It is he who attacked
Tronchin, accused Bordeu of stealing a watch and sleeve-links off

</div>


<p>We must now return to the Bishop of Wilna,
and see what had befallen him since 1772.
We left him settled in Paris, as though he
intended to remain there for life. Through his
amiable disposition, cultivated mind, and
taste for science and erudition, he formed
many ties there. He was even made an
Associated Member of the Academy of <i>Inscriptions</i>
and <i>Belles Lettres</i>, and Madame
Geoffrin, certain of her influence over him,
was persuaded that he no longer meddled
with politics. She little understood the
changeable and restless mind of her protégé.
Since the month of January 1773 the Prince-Bishop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
had left Paris, and the following is a
letter Madame Geoffrin received from the
King of Poland:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<i>16th April 1773.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“The Bishop Massalski, after having
urgently requested my uncle to judge his
cause, after having refused to give him
colleagues, as my uncle had himself proposed,
has induced the Austrian minister to interfere
by means of the authority, or rather the
power, which his Court exercises in Poland,
in order to prevent his suit being judged by
my uncle, who, if the truth be known, is only
too glad to be rid of the whole business.
This inconsiderate conduct has greatly discredited
the Bishop. It is a pity, for I have
always said that there is a great deal of
good in this Bishop.”</p>
</div>

<p>Madame Geoffrin, although very much
embarrassed at having to explain the Bishop’s
conduct, endeavoured still to find excuses
for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Madame Geoffrin to the King.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<i>2d May 1773</i><br>
</p>

<p>“I will at once answer your Majesty about
the Bishop of Wilna. It is true that he has
an amiable and gentle disposition that becomes
him in society; but his character is
so weak that he is incapable of keeping
the resolutions he makes with the best
intentions. The first person who cajoles
him, or who raises the least suspicion in his
mind, distracts him, so that he does not know
on what he can rely. He has written to me,
and I could see that he was in a great fright
on writing to inform me of the new aspect of
his affairs. He fears that this may estrange
your Majesty from his cause. I assured him
of the contrary, and told him I was certain
that your Majesty and also the Prince
Chancellor would be very glad to avoid
judging this affair, which in all probability
never will be tried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“He has left us the Abbé Baudeau, to
whom, as well as to Colonel Saint Leu, he
had made the most splendid promises. They
are both much attached to his person; and if
he forgets them I do not know what will
become of them. Saint Leu is perfectly
devoted to the Bishop.”</p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile nearly all the exiled senators
who had taken part in the Confederation of
Bar were restored to favour, and returned to
Poland to take their seats in the Senate.
The Bishop of Wilna arrived amongst the first.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The King Stanislaus-Augustus to
Madame Geoffrin.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Bishop of Wilna, when writing to
inform you that my uncle would not judge
his business, might have informed you also of
several other changes in his conduct and in
his principles. He is now the intimate friend
of those who, not satisfied with having
despoiled me of three-quarters of my kingdom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
are anxious to deprive me to a very great
extent of my royal prerogatives.</p>

<p>“Moreover the appointment of a Permanent
Council is contemplated, which will grant
pardons instead of the King, and superintend,
besides, all the transactions that take place
between the Diets.</p>

<p>“Such are their intentions with regard to
us. I was only informed of their decision at
the opening of the Diet by the three Powers
who have dismembered the kingdom.”</p>
</div>

<p>The creation of the Permanent Council
that the King dreaded was decided in August
1774. The delegations of Poland had
resumed their sittings on the 1st of August.
The ministers of the three Powers were
present at the Assembly, and proposed the
plan of a Permanent Council. The scheme
met with the most strenuous opposition in the
following sittings, especially on the part of
the Lithuanian deputies; however, it was
reported that the King had already given his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
consent to the establishment of the council,
and deputies were immediately sent to his
Majesty in order to hear him confirm this
rumour. The report was true: the King with
his customary weakness had submitted.
Pleading illness, he begged for a delay of
several days, during which time he secretly
hoped that the Bishop of Wilna would persuade
the Lithuanian deputies to consent to the
scheme.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Some slight modifications were made
and urged by the foreign ministers, the King
and the delegation were obliged to assent, and
on the 7th of August the project was signed.</p>

<p>This may be considered as the date
of the overthrowing of the ancient Polish
constitution, and of the utter annihilation of
the sovereign power.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Wilna had returned to
Paris with a portfolio crammed full of
schemes: “He had consulted all the
philosophers of the time on the state of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
Poland, and brought back plans borrowed
from Rousseau and Mably, etc. He fancied
he would find the salvation of his country
in the abstract paradoxes of the former, or
in the democratic delirium of the latter;
and the confused state of his mind, open
to every theory, exposed him to numerous
delusions.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>He was named a member of the Permanent
Council, and the King had little reason to be
satisfied with his conduct. In the Warsaw
paper called <i>Journal Encyclopédique</i> we find
the following: “As for the Bishops of
Cajavia and Wilna, they persist in distinguishing
themselves by their constant
opposition to the King’s wishes.”</p>

<p>Madame Geoffrin also writes to the King:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<i>19th September.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“As long as the Bishop of Wilna was in
Paris, I could see how weak he was and how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
much he required to be guided.... When
I saw him start for Poland, without taking
either of his two acolytes, I foresaw all that
would occur. I am more than ever convinced
that one can have no confidence in weak
minds and frivolous characters. The poor
man will be his own dupe; others will
avenge your Majesty.”</p>
</div>

<p>In this case Madame Geoffrin showed
herself a true prophet; but in the meantime
honours and distinctions were being
showered on the head of the Prince-Bishop.
The Polish Government had lately
constituted a body for the general direction
of public instruction. This body received the
name of Commissioners of National Education,
and the Bishop was appointed president. It
proceeded to reorganise the studies which
had been completely interrupted by the
suppression of the Jesuits, who until then had
educated the Polish youth. It was decided
that the sale of their possessions should
furnish the capital necessary for the founding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
of schools and universities as well as for
the purchase and printing of the students’
books.</p>

<p>While the Bishop of Wilna was busied
with the education of his countrymen the
tutor he had chosen during his stay in Paris for
his own nephew, Prince Xavier, was discharging
his functions in the worst possible manner.
The Bishop had not wished to send the child
to college on account of his delicate state of
health. He preferred confiding him to some
trustworthy man, who would be exclusively
attached to his person. Madame Geoffrin
consulted her friends on the subject, and
Masson de Pezay,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> a clever intriguer, a
colonel and a poet, proposed his uncle, M.
Boesnier-Delorme; he was a commissioner
of woods and forests, a talented man and
accustomed to good society, but his head
was turned by the economists, and he was
infatuated with their new theories.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, as he was warmly
recommended both by the Marquis de Mirabeau
and the Abbé Baudeau, for whom the
Bishop had a great regard, the offer was accepted.
A salary of thirty thousand livres<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
per annum was agreed upon for M. Delorme,
including an under-tutor, a gentleman, and
a lackey, who were more specially assigned to
the child’s service. The same amount was
offered to Masson de Pezay on signing the
agreement, and a further sum of sixty thousand
livres was promised besides to M. Delorme
when his pupil’s education should be finished.</p>

<p>It would have been difficult to make a
worse choice. M. Delorme spent his time
travelling for the benefit of his agricultural
affairs, and squandered his money in costly experiments
on his property near Blois, situated
on the banks of the Loire. During the winter
he resided chiefly in Paris, where he faithfully
attended the receptions of the Baron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
d’Holbach and Madame Geoffrin, as well as
the political dinners given by the Marquis
de Mirabeau. As for his pupil, he dragged
him about in his summer travels, and during
the winter left him at the mercy of underlings
without exercising the slightest supervision.
The child, barely seven years old, and an
orphan from his birth, was puny and delicate,
and would have required a mother’s incessant
care. Instead of getting stronger, his health
deteriorated from bad to worse; either left
to himself, or ill-treated by a brutal and
ignorant under-tutor, encouraged in low and
precocious instincts by a debauched lackey,
the unfortunate child contracted bad habits,
and when, at the end of the term fixed for his
education, the uncle claimed his return to
Poland in 1778, M. Delorme brought back a
child of fourteen, half crazy, absolutely ignorant,
and in a most deplorable state of health.
It is easy to understand the indignation of
the Bishop, who had been carefully kept
in ignorance of his nephew’s condition. M.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
Delorme did not dare to face an interview.
He sent the young Prince to Wilna accompanied
by a servant, and prudently remained
himself at Warsaw. He had, nevertheless,
the audacity to claim the 60,000 livres
promised on the completion of Prince Xavier’s
education. The Bishop flatly refused it, and
only paid the travelling expenses. But by
dint of successful scheming in Warsaw
Delorme obtained a sum of 20,000 francs
from the family council, and returned in
haste to Paris. He had received 30,000
livres during six years—that is, 180,000
plus 3600 at the outset, and 20,000 at the
end, which made up a total of 230,000
livres,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> in payment for so successful an
education.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The young Prince was settled at Werky,
in the magnificent residence of his uncle, at
a short distance from Wilna. He was treated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
with the most tender care, his uncle never let
him out of his sight, and took him with him
during his frequent visits to Warsaw. A
confidential man named Levert was attached
to his person; he was sent by the Marquis
de Mirabeau, who, indignant at Delorme’s
conduct, and most distressed at having recommended
him, had remained on the best
of terms with the Prince-Bishop. It was
precisely at this period that unforeseen
circumstances, in which Hélène was concerned,
gave rise to a rather curious correspondence
between the Bishop and the
Marquis.</p>

<p>While Hélène was bringing to a close the
story of her peaceful years of convent life,
the reputation of her beauty, her name, and
her fortune had spread beyond the walls of
the old Abbey.</p>

<p>The young Princess had already made her
appearance at children’s balls. The Duchesses
de Mortemart, de Châtillon, du Châtelet, de
Choiseul, and others, whose daughters or
nieces were her companions, often took
Hélène out with them. More than one
mother, anxious for her son’s provision in
life, had turned her thoughts towards the
little Pole, and disposed her artillery with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
view towards securing auxiliaries in the field.
The young girl was not long in finding this
out, but with much discretion she appeared
not to notice anything. Her plans were
already marked out; she was better acquainted
than any one with her uncle’s weakness
of character, and knew well she would
only make the marriage she chose. Two
suitors came forward at the same time. The
first was the Duc d’Elbœuf, Prince de
Vaudemont, second son of the Comtesse de
Brionne, of the house of Rohan-Rochefort,
and of Comte Charles-Louis de Lorraine,
Grand Equerry of France. Though of such
noble birth, the Prince’s fortune was small,
and an alliance with a rich heiress was for
him the chief object in view. The Comtesse
de Brionne, an intimate friend of the Duc
de Choiseul, saw Hélène at Chanteloup.
The grace and charm of the young girl attracted
her attention, and on returning to
Paris she carefully informed herself of both
Hélène’s present and future prospects. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
has not been forgotten that at the beginning
of her <i>Memoirs</i> the little Princess mentions
the Comtesse de Rochefort as a friend of her
uncle’s. This lady and her friend, the
Marquis de Mirabeau, were among those
who frequented the Comtesse de Brionne’s
receptions. The Marquis de Mirabeau was,
as we know, a great friend of the Bishop
of Wilna, and kept up a constant correspondence
with him; nothing was therefore easier
than for the Countess to procure all the information
she desired.</p>

<p>It was in this small circle that was woven
the matrimonial plot which is now to be unfolded
before our eyes, and we can see how
in those days, as at present, slight importance
was attached to mutual feeling, or to conformity
of taste or character; fortune, rank,
and name were the only conditions required.</p>

<p>It was decided that the Marquis de Mirabeau
should open fire by writing to the
Bishop. But it was felt that he could not
bring the affair to a good issue unassisted;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
his haughty and violent temper, the uncertainty
of his disposition, required the
controlling influence of a feminine mind.
The right person was ready to hand, and
Madame de Pailly, whose intimacy with the
Marquis was well known, was deputed to
assist him in this matter.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Madame de Pailly was very pretty, and possessed
a quick, shrewd intelligence, well fitted
for intrigue. The great Mirabeau, who had
good reason to hate her, wrote as follows:—</p>

<p>“This woman has the cleverness of five
hundred thousand demons, or angels, if you
prefer it; but she is equally dangerous by
reason of her beauty, and her intensely
designing disposition.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>
<p>We are not concerned with the unedifying
position that Madame de Pailly occupied in
the Mirabeau family;<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> we merely conclude
that she must have conducted herself with
sufficient reserve or decency, as it was then
called, to be admitted into the society of the
Comtesse de Brionne and that of her aunt,
the Princesse de Ligne-Luxembourg. The
<i>black hen</i>, as she was called by her intimates,
was delighted to play a part in this affair.
She desired beyond everything to be useful
to such great ladies, and neglected nothing
to attain this end. Madame de Pailly’s
letters were quoted in her society “as
models of sentiment and elegance;” we may
add of acuteness and moderation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>26th December 1777</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>“I enclose, Madame, a copy of M. de Mirabeau’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
letter to the Bishop. On handing it to
me yesterday morning he said: ‘Be assured
that this negotiation will succeed; Providence
will aid you. I could not have written
you this morning, but having suffered all
night from a violent attack of asthma I
employed the time in doing so. It may have
suffered from my condition,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> but nevertheless
I think I have said all that was necessary.’</p>

<p>“He begs the Comtesse de Brionne will
forgive the freedom with which he has spoken
of her and her family; he thought it advisable
to preserve towards the Bishop the same
frankness he has always shown him, and,
moreover, that his letter should not appear
to have been dictated. The Abbé<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> was
quite satisfied with it.</p>

<p>“We are agreed as to what he (the Abbé)
should say in his letter. He will resolutely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
treat the question of the dowry, and will make
all necessary observations. He even adds that
in order to influence the undecided character
of the Bishop he will enclose in his letter a
copy of the answer he should send the
Marquis de Mirabeau. The Abbé has often
used this plan with success on previous
occasions.</p>

<p>“He does not appear much alarmed at the
competition of the ‘modern prince,’<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and following
the usual bent of his mind, which leads
him to believe in what he wishes, he does
not doubt for one moment of our success in
this affair, and will carry it through rapidly.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Marquis de Mirabeau was perhaps
not the best person for a negotiation of this
sort, and his nature was certainly not conciliatory;
but in spite of his violence, his
tyrannical character, and fantastical ideas, his
was not an ordinary intelligence. He had
much observation, and expressed his ideas in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
an original, glowing, and picturesque style,
though occasionally somewhat obscure.</p>

<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>25th December 1777</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>—My gratitude for your kindness,
and the affection I feel in return for the
friendship you have conferred upon me, have
caused me to entertain an idea which I think
suitable both as regards the greatness of
your family and your own happiness. I have
conducted the affair to a point where, if it
meets with your approval, it can be further
developed, but without compromising you
in the slightest degree should you have other
intentions.</p>

<p>“I know your affection for the scions of
your illustrious family, whose destiny both law
and nature, the will of their ancestor,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and their
own helplessness, have confided to your care.</p>

<p>“I have not forgotten that it formed part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
your plan that the young Princess, your niece,
should be established in France. I have
heard that she has given much satisfaction,
and that each day she has shown herself more
worthy of your care and affection. I have
therefore thought of an alliance worthy of
you in every way. Next in rank to our
Princes of the blood, who, though always
‘peers’ of the blood were only raised by law
above the other peers less than two centuries
ago, we have nothing in France that can
equal the House of Lorraine.</p>

<p>“This family is now reduced in France to
two branches. One of them is almost extinct;
the only remaining male representative being
the Prince de Marsan, who has never married.
The other branch is that of the Princes of
Lambesc, Grand Equerries of France, at whose
head stands the beautiful Comtesse de Brionne,
whom you know,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and who occupies her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
position with as much dignity as splendour.
This Princess has been left a widow with two
sons and two daughters. The two Princes
are: the Prince de Lambesc, Grand Equerry,
and the Duc d’Elbœuf,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> a young Prince
eighteen years of age, of a fine, noble mien
and gentle character, with whom all his
family are satisfied—a rare thing anywhere, in
the present day, especially with us. The
eldest, the Prince de Lambesc, has until now
refused to marry with a persistency that time
alone can overcome.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> His younger brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
even went so far as to throw himself at his
feet to implore him to do so on one important
occasion.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> The two brothers are very amicable.
It is on the Prince d’Elbœuf that I have
cast my eye, as representing, in the interim,
the sole hope of his family, and I thought it
well not to delay.</p>

<p>“Madame de Brionne is very clever, very
watchful over the interests of her family,
especially with regard to the settlement of
her children. Active, without being restless,
noble and elevated in her ideas on
general matters, easy on questions of detail,
amiable to the exact degree or extent she
chooses, but having never displeased anybody
or anything any more than her own
mirror. This is not a portrait: it is a plain
description, such as is necessary, for all
depends upon her; she will be a pillar of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
support—to the young Princess, who, with
her noble mind and ardent feelings, will
prosper under such guidance; to the young
couple also, who will require sustaining and
directing; and lastly, to your Lordship, when
you come to live amongst us; for if I cared
for society I should prefer the dull moments
of Madame de Brionne to the wittiest of all
the others.</p>

<p>“Pray take counsel with yourself, my Lord,
and send me word if I am to withdraw my
promises. Any other will follow up the
affair as well, and better, than I can, and
ought even to do so. But I alone could give
you my idea with all its developments. If
the plan suits you avoid all delays. State
things exactly as they are to be, so that we
may consider them as signed and ratified.</p>

<p>“In any case, pray forgive the liberty I
have taken by interfering in your affairs, and
consider me, etc.</p>

<p>“<i>P.S.</i>—I ask: 1. If the idea meets with
your approval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>“2. The conditions you require.</p>

<p>“3. Those you will grant.”</p>
</div>

<p>While this negotiation was being carried on
Hélène had met, in the course of her frequent
appearances in society, Prince Frédéric<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> de
Salm, who had come as if by chance to
a young ladies’ ball. His reputation as a
successful man of the world, his debts, and
his conduct, did little credit to the name he
bore. Unscrupulous in the choice of his
amusements, frequenting the worst society, of
doubtful courage, he commanded in Paris no
sort of consideration. He was reproached,
on the occasion of a duel he fought with an
officer of the King’s guards, with having
taken the precaution of secretly protecting himself
with a large muff. On arriving at the
ground he refused to undress, and rushed on
his adversary unawares. The latter gave him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
a thrust that would have pierced him through
and through had it not been for the protecting
muff. The recoil caused by this obstacle
threw the officer to the ground, and the seconds
had all the difficulty in the world to prevent
the Prince from killing his fallen adversary.</p>

<p>The Prince de Salm had a handsome face,
easy manners, a gay disposition, and a supple
mind. Hélène ignored the dishonourable
details of his private life. She only saw in
him an elegant cavalier, bearing a great name,
and above all, the certainty of a fixed residence
in Paris, in the magnificent mansion the
Salms had built, on the Quay d’Orsay.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>She would not hear of the Duc d’Elbœuf,
in spite of his brilliant prospects; she dreaded
Madame de Brionne as a mother-in-law, and
allowed herself to be strongly influenced by
the Prince de Salm’s friends, who did not miss
an opportunity of exciting the young girl’s
imagination. The Bishop, led by his niece,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
returned an ambiguous answer, adjourned
his decision, spoke of a probable journey
to Paris, and ended by no longer concealing
the fresh candidature of the Prince de Salm.</p>

<p>The Comtesse de Brionne ardently desired
to continue the negotiations, and she consulted
Mirabeau as to the best means of attaining
her end. The Marquis replied in a long
letter, of which the following is an extract:<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>—</p>

<p>“It is absolutely necessary that the
Countess should have as representative a
staid and honourable man, acting on her
authority, and capable of defeating the
intrigues he will meet with. National
jealousy, errors of fact, important changes
in places and ideas, distractions and dissipations
of all kinds, in fact every sort of disappointment,
await him; quite enough to
worry out of his mind any sensible man.</p>

<p>“It must, however, be borne in mind that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
he must not be expected to conclude, treat,
or decide anything, but only to obtain ample
and reliable information as to the family
possessions, customs, etc., to keep the Bishop
in a favourable frame of mind, to sketch out
the conditions with him, and try to bring him
round to our views. I cannot deny that this
is too much to expect from a man alone, in
a strange country; for this there is only
one remedy, which, if we can obtain it, I
think will succeed—it is to get the Abbé
Baudeau to accompany him on the journey.
I know all that can be said against him, and he
is the first to own his faults; he would spoil
any business requiring time, but an affair that
has to be carried off at the outset is quite
another matter, and he is the first man in
Europe for that kind of thing, thanks to his
business-like aptitude and resources. He is
ingenious, insinuating, as good as he is scatterbrained,
of easy and lively habits, knowing
how to influence the Bishop, which he does,
not by thwarting him, but by turning him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
round like a glove. In short, whatever objections
there may be to him, we cannot have
men made on purpose. This one has a clear
head, and will elucidate matters both here and
over there; he enjoys the confidence of the
young Princess, and knows how to manage
her; he can work up the Bishop as he pleases.
In fact, even had he none of these advantages,
which I consider quite exceptional for the
affair in hand, or did he not know the country
as he does, I should think it of capital importance
to employ him in carrying through
a business of this kind.</p>

<p>“What I can guarantee, not only as the
result of my express warning, but also by
the fact that he has already suffered from
it, is, that he will not meddle with politics
or economy, or any other subject of discussion,
and that, provided his travelling
companion behaves to him in a simple and
friendly way, neither allowing himself to be
ruled by him, nor still less contradicting him
openly, he will be quite satisfied with him, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
will find him most useful. I must appear to
write at great length on this subject, but I
assure you that I am actuated by no prejudice.
In reality I have more liking than is supposed
for sensible business; but try watering cabbages
with lavender water, and you will see
if they grow!...”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the Marquis’s eloquence,
the Abbé Baudeau did not start for Poland,
as the negotiations fell through. By
a second letter the Prince-Bishop, under
the influence of his niece, declined for her
the honour of entering the house of
Lorraine.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The unsuccessful result of the
negotiations undertaken by Madame de
Pailly had vexed her much; she feared the
displeasure of the Comtesse de Brionne, and
still more that of her aunt, the Princesse de
Ligne-Luxembourg,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> whom she had special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
reasons for wishing to please. The Princess,
formerly lady-in-waiting to the late Queen
of Spain, had, by virtue of that office, been
given by the King an apartment in the
palace of the Tuileries. She received a
limited but carefully-chosen circle, of which
Madame de Pailly would have been proud to
form part, though the society was a very dull
one. The old Princess, according to her
contemporaries, had the most hideous fifty-year-old
face that had ever been seen, a fat,
shiny countenance, without any rouge, lividly
pale, and adorned with a chin three stories
deep. The Duchesse de Tallard used to say
“that she was like a dripping tallow-candle.”
But she was obliging and kind, and soon consoled
herself for the failure of the projected
marriage. She confided to the negotiating
lady that she had another scheme in view.
This time she had turned her thoughts to
Prince Charles de Ligne, nephew of her late
husband. In point of fortune the young
Prince’s position was far superior to that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
the Duc d’Elbœuf, and if his family occupied
in France a less elevated rank than that of
the house of Lorraine—which was a reigning
family—on the score of nobility it was inferior
to none.</p>

<p>Madame de Pailly, delighted at the confidence
the Princess reposed in her, thanked
her for it as for a favour, and set to work,
resolved to profit by the experience she had
acquired and avoid another failure.</p>

<p>She began by making the Abbé Baudeau
and the Marquis write to the Prince-Bishop
that nothing could be concluded in his
absence, and that among the crowd of
suitors, which every day increased, it was
impossible he could discern at a distance
what would be the best match for his
niece.</p>

<p>Then she cleverly tried to discover what
was the influence which had been brought to
bear on the young Princess that disposed her
so strongly in favour of the Prince de Salm.
She learned that he had gained over to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
cause one of the lady residents in the Convent,
whom Hélène frequently went to see.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Once fully acquainted with all the details
of the situation, she drew up her batteries
accordingly, and won over to her side
three of Hélène’s best friends: the young
Duchesse de Choiseul and Mesdemoiselles de
Conflans. She got mutual friends to urge
them quietly to influence the young Princess,
and then patiently awaited the arrival of the
Bishop, which could not long be delayed.</p>

<p>Before seriously opening up negotiations
the Princesse de Ligne had written to Prince
Charles and his mother to inform them of
her plan, and of the advantages she saw in
this alliance. But she did not hide the
preference over his numerous competitors
which the young girl showed towards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
Prince Frédéric de Salm. Prince Charles
did not seem very much flattered, and wrote
to his aunt as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<i>March 1779.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“I have received, my dear aunt, the letters
you have had the goodness to write to me,
and have immediately forwarded them to my
father. I foresee that there will be many
difficulties in the affair you mention. It will
require all the perseverance you possess with
regard to what interests you, and tax to
the utmost your kindness towards the whole
of our family; a kindness whereof we are
deeply sensible, and for which once more,
my dear aunt, we offer you our best thanks.</p>

<p>“The little lady appears to me of decided
character, and not very delicate in her choice,
since she prefers the Prince de Salm, who
has such a bad reputation. I only hope the
Bishop will not decide! for it takes so long
to receive the answers.</p>

<p>“Receive, my dear aunt, etc.”</p>
</div>

<p>From this letter it appears that the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
Prince was not very much delighted at the
proposed marriage, but his mother took up
the matter with more eagerness, and begged
her cousin to continue the negotiations.</p>

<p>The latter, then staying at her niece’s,
Madame de Brionne, in the Château de
Limours, wrote to Madame de Pailly, and
offered to come herself to Paris to talk
over the great affair. Madame de Pailly
replies:—</p>

<p>“I had hoped, Madame, that this week
would not have elapsed without your coming to
Paris. I greatly desire to have the honour
of seeing you, in order to tell you about our
affair. You may be sure that I have made
the best possible use of what you deigned
to inform me. It would be too long for
me to write to you all that has been said on
one side and on the other, but the last word of
<i>our uncle</i> is that he must know what will be
the total fortune of the young Prince in the
future, and what allowance his father means to
give him at present. He has repeated several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
times that that was the essential point to be
cleared up; that he found all the other conditions
most suitable; that with regard to the
residence in Brussels, his niece was very-sensible,
and that he flattered himself he
would have no difficulty in persuading her, if
that was the only obstacle in the way.</p>

<p>“It is true that he adds: ‘But may we
not hope that the Prince de Ligne will come
to Paris?’ I answered that I thought not,
and, indeed, that this change of residence
would not be to his advantage; that I
thought his niece would find it very agreeable
to be at the same time a great lady in
Brussels, in Vienna, and at Versailles; that
the Prince de Ligne’s establishments in Flanders
were such that they were preferable
to any that might be had elsewhere....”</p>

<p>Madame de Pailly conducted the whole
business very cleverly. She called on the
young Princess, and, feigning to ignore the
preference that Hélène openly avowed for
the Prince de Salm, she carefully avoided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
mentioning the subject. But she boldly
faced the other obstacle—that of an establishment
in Brussels.</p>

<p>She dwelt at great length on the exceptional
position of the Princes de Ligne in
Vienna and in the Netherlands. Then she
gave a most brilliant description of that
occupied by the Prince’s father at Versailles,
where he spent most of his time when free
from military service. She gave Hélène to
understand that with the great preference the
Prince showed for the French Court, she would
easily find in him an ally towards obtaining
an establishment in Paris; for he adored his
son, and would be happy to have him near.
Only it was essential to gain time, and care
must be taken not to clash with the Princesse
de Ligne, who was the least disposed to
accept this arrangement.</p>

<p>This conversation made a tolerably deep
impression on Hélène, who, for the first
time, did not oppose a formal refusal to the
proposed alliance with the Prince de Ligne;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
she merely asked to be allowed to reflect,
and to await the arrival of her uncle before
taking a decision. The delay was granted
the more easily that the Princes de Ligne,
both father and son, were at that time engaged
with the army, Austria being at war
with Prussia as to the succession of the electorate
of Bavaria.</p>

<p>We will now leave Hélène to her reflections,
and turn our attention to the two
personages who are about to play such an
important part in her life.</p>

Colonel and owner of a regiment of Walloon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
infantry, and chamberlain to their Imperial
Majesties.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>These honours were certainly sufficient to
satisfy the highest ambition, but they were
not all. In addition to all these titles we
must add the position enjoyed by the Prince de
Ligne at Versailles, Vienna, and Brussels—a
position acquired by his brilliant personal
qualities. Handsome, brave, generous, chivalrous,
gifted with a dazzling imagination, lively
wit, and a mind full of impulsive brilliancy,
he was, notwithstanding all these advantages,
the most unaffected of men. He is mentioned
in all contemporary memoirs, even by those
of most diverse opinions. Mesdames de Staël,
de Genlis, the Comte de Ségur, the adventurer
Casanova, the Emperor Joseph, Voltaire, the
Empress Catherine, and others, all unite in a
concert of praise, and not a discordant note
jars upon the general harmony. Madame
de Staël winds up her portrait of him by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
saying, like Eschine: “If you are astonished
at what I say of him, how much more so
would you be if you knew him!” Such was
the future father-in-law of Hélène.</p>

<p>Prince Charles-Joseph had been brought
up by his father in the strictest manner.
“My father did not care for me,” he says:
“I know not why, for we hardly knew
each other. He never spoke to me; it was
not the fashion at that time to be either a
good father or a good husband. My mother
feared him extremely. She gave birth to
me dressed in her farthingale, and died in
the same dress, a few weeks later, so strict was
he as to appearances and stately formalities.”</p>

<p>His military career was most brilliant, and
his promotion rapid. At the age of twenty
he was named colonel of his father’s regiment
of dragoons. He immediately wrote to
inform him of the fact, and the following is
the answer he received:—</p>

<p>“It was already unfortunate enough for
me, sir, to have you as a son without the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
additional misfortune of having you as my
colonel.”</p>

<p>His son replied: “My lord, neither the
one nor the other are my fault, and it is the
Emperor your Highness must make responsible
for the second misfortune.”</p>

<p>The Prince married in 1755 the Princesse
de Lichtenstein,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and in September 1759,
while he was busy fighting the Prussians
before Meissen, he received the news of the
birth of a son.</p>

<p>“I have a son,” he writes joyfully. “Ah!
how I shall love him; I already wish I could
write and tell him so.... If I come back
from this war I shall say to him: ‘Be welcome:
I am sure I am going to love you
with all my heart!’”</p>

<p>The Prince had suffered too severely
from the harshness of his father to be willing
to imitate it. All his children were brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
up with the greatest affection, but he was
never able to refrain from showing a marked
preference to the eldest, Prince Charles,
suitor to our young Princess. He taught him
what he knew so well himself—“to fight
like a gentleman.” The little Prince, while
still a child, was led to battle by his father.</p>

<p>“I had a slight skirmish at the outposts
with the Prussians,” he says, “and, jumping
into the saddle with him as we galloped
along, I took his little hand in mine. At
the first shot I ordered I said to him: ‘It
would be charming, my Charles, if we had a
little wound together.’ And he laughed, and
swore, and became excited, and spoke quite
judiciously!”</p>

<p>After having been at Strasburg<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> for four
years, Prince Charles entered the Austrian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
service, at the age of sixteen, as second
lieutenant of engineers. He would have
preferred the artillery, but chose the engineers
to please his father.</p>

<p>At the moment when the negotiations for
Hélène’s marriage were begun war had just
broken out between Austria and Prussia, on
the question of the succession in Bavaria,
and the two Princes de Ligne were with the
Austrian army.</p>

<p>The Elector of Bavaria, Maximilian-Joseph,
had died on the 30th of December 1777
without male issue. Notwithstanding the
indisputable rights of the Elector-Palatine,
several other princes raised pretensions to the
succession. The most formidable of these
pretenders was the Emperor Joseph II.
Barely had the Elector closed his eyes when
the Austrian troops marched on the Bavarian
frontier.</p>

<p>This caused great uneasiness in Prussia,
and the young Duc des Deux-Ponts, urged
on and supported by Frederick the Great,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
protested before the Germanic Diet against
Austria’s designs. The Elector of Saxony
followed his example, and while this serious
discussion was going on Joseph and Frederick
went, the one into Silesia, the other into
Bohemia, to take command of the large armies
they had raised. They remained thus in
presence of each other for several months.
Marie-Thérèse, who feared war, carried on
secret negotiations to stop it. Joseph, on the
contrary, anxious for a contest with the great
Frederick, urged it on with all his might.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The Austrian army was divided into two
corps, the one officially commanded by the
Emperor, but in reality by Marshal de Lascy,
and the other by Marshal Laudon; it included
the Lycanians or Croats, and picked grenadier
regiments under the Prince de Ligne.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
His headquarters were at Bezesnow, in
Bohemia. His son was in Marshal de Lascy’s
corps, occupying a strong position behind the
steep banks of the Elbe; three lines of forts
defended the passage of the river. Prince
Charles was in fact principally occupied with
the construction of these forts, and his father
constantly wrote to him. The following
letters will show the affectionate terms that
existed between them. It would appear that
Prince Charles was dissatisfied at the manner
in which the fortifications were being made,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 5.5em;"><i>From my Headquarters at</i></span><br>
<span class="smcap">Bezesnow</span>, <i>26th June 1778</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>“Well, my engineer, so you are still fortifying
your position, but you are not fortifying
your esteem for the genius of our engineers?
I have much trouble, on my side, to fortify
myself against <i>ennui</i>.</p>

<p>“The Emperor came here to make what
we may well call a fuss. He said he wished
for war, but did not believe in it. ‘<i>Who will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
take a bet?</i>’ he said to us the other day.
‘<i>Everybody</i>,’ replied Marshal Laudon, who is
always in a bad temper. ‘<i>Everybody means
nobody!</i>’—‘<i>But I for one will bet</i>,’ said Marshal
Lascy. ‘<i>How much?</i>’ said the Emperor,
who expected him to propose about twenty
ducats. ‘<i>Two hundred thousand florins</i>,’ said
the Marshal. The Emperor pulled a long
face, and felt he had received a public
reprimand.</p>

<p>“He has been very gracious to me. He
is in constant fear lest one should play the
pedant by him. He was satisfied with my
troops, and said many nice things about you,
my dear Charles, for he had seen you work
marvellously well. He has just left; I can
still see him from my windows.</p>

<p>“I laugh at myself and the others when
I think that, unappreciated though I be, I
value myself so much more than they suppose.
I personally superintend every platoon. I
make myself hoarse with giving the word of
command to six battalions at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>“I personally inspect even the very smallest
huts, called in Bohemia <i>kaloups</i>, each containing
only four soldiers, and taste their soup,
their bread, weigh their meat, in order to see
that they are not cheated. There is not one
whom I do not talk to, whom I do not supply
with something; not an officer I do not feed,
and whom I do not rouse to the war. My
comrades do nothing of this kind, and they are
very wise, as no one cares. Not one of them
cares for the war; they utter the most pacific
speeches before the young men, whom they
expect in the future to be zealous and good
generals. This is also very well. They will
be made generals before I shall, and that
also will be very well.</p>

<p>“It is six weeks since I have spoken a word
of French; but, on the other hand, to repay
me for a tiresome dinner, I have the pleasure,
on leaving the table, of receiving thirty bows
at a time.”</p>

<p>“If an infantry officer may salute an engineer
in the exercise of his genius, I embrace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
you, my dear boy. I am delighted that you
should get praised for doing bad work. Good-bye,
my excellent work; good-bye, my master-piece,
almost as much so as Christine.”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the meantime the Emperor and the
King of Prussia remained stationary, constantly
exchanging letters. The Prince de
Ligne, who was well posted up, kept his son
informed of what was going on.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Bezesnow</span>, <i>5th July</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>“I have this moment heard that the
Marshal asked the Emperor, on Saint John’s
Day, how he had answered the letter he had
received that day from the King of Prussia.
‘I have nonplussed him,’ he answered; ‘I represented
that the season was advancing, and
that I wished to receive some lessons from so
great a master. When do you think, my
dear Marshal, that I shall get his answer?’
The Marshal counted on his fingers, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
replied: ‘In eight days; but he will bring it
himself to your Majesty.’</p>

<p>“I have just heard that he has entered
Bohemia; to-day is the 5th July, the calculation
is exact; so much the better; I have
received orders to march with all my corps.”</p>
</div>

<p>The King of Prussia had suddenly made
his appearance at Nachod, at the head of his
advanced guard. “We hoped it,” says the
Prince de Ligne, “but did not expect it.” He
writes to his son:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<i>July.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“As I do not suppose you have already
left Pardubitz for the army, I must write and
give you some news of it. The Emperor
was informed that the King was advancing
at the head of I do not know how many columns.
He went at full gallop to the redoubt
number 7, and asked about twenty times:
‘Where is the Marshal?’ The latter came
up slowly for the first time in his life: ‘Well,
Field-Marshal, I have had you looked for
everywhere.’—‘Well, Sire, there is the King.—Give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
me your spy-glass.... Ah! there
he is himself, I bet! on a large English horse
... perhaps his Anhalt, look.’—‘That is
possible; but they have not come alone to
beat us; look at the strength of the columns,
Oh! there is one that certainly numbers ten
thousand men. They are coming to attack
us?’—‘Perhaps, what o’clock is it?’—‘Eleven
o’clock.’—‘They will only be in battle line in
two hours’ time, then they will cook their
dinner, so shall we; they will certainly not
attack your Majesty to-day.’—‘No, but to-morrow?’—‘To-morrow!
I think not, nor the
day after, nor even at all during this campaign.’</p>

<p>“You will recognise the phlegmatic and
bitter style of our excellent Marshal, annoyed
at the constant interference and anxiety of the
Emperor, who on these occasions feels that
he is not master of the situation.”</p>
</div>

<p>At last the war began, but the opposing
parties contented themselves with observing
each other’s movements. Prince Charles rejoined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
his father at Mickenhau on the 30th
of July, and he became one of his aides-de-camp;
he was always to be found at the
outposts, and in the midst of danger was
remarkably cool and courageous. His father
constantly speaks of him with a pride that he
cannot conceal: “Charles is splendid under
fire; I cannot restrain his ardour, he has such
presence of mind, such spirits and animation,
that he encourages every one. I must also add
that the Emperor is very much pleased with
him.” It is thus that the Prince expresses
himself in the picturesque and delightful
description he has given of this Bavarian
war; a war presenting this peculiarity, that
not a shot was fired in Bavaria, and that
two armies of more than a hundred thousand
men, one commanded by the King of Prussia,
the other by the Emperor of Austria, remained
during nine months in sight of each other
without fighting a single battle, contenting
themselves with slight skirmishes or small
outpost attacks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>The Prince, in despair at this state of inaction,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
seized every opportunity of attacking
the enemy. We will quote the account he
gives of the fight of Pösig; it was the first
action in which Prince Charles took part, and
had a great influence on his military career.</p>

<p>“Prince Henry’s<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> hussars had taken up a
strong position on the heights of Hühnerwasser.
In order to dislodge them it was
necessary first to take the Convent of Pösig,
where there was a small garrison of about
forty men, who spent their days watching all
that took place in our camp. This perpetual
spying irritated M. de Laudon a great deal.
I told him that Colonel d’Aspremont had
already proposed to attack them, but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
even if the position were carried it would be
difficult to retain it, being situated nearer to
Prince Henry than to us. He told me to try
if I could.... But the garrison was on the
watch. A sentinel had been placed at the door
of the monk who gave me information, the
main entrance to the Convent had been barricaded,
and they had raised trestles. The
brave Lycanians began the attack an hour
before daybreak, at the very moment that I
was drawing up my men on the small plain.
Fifty were chosen to form the scaling party.
All wanted to go, but there were only five
ladders, and if I had sent for more the news
would have spread in the country. Although
the ladders were short, one of the brave
Croatians was killed on the wall. On arriving
they were greeted by a shower of stones, and
Colonel d’Aspremont could no longer restrain
them. The excellent and worthy Lieutenant
Wolf went up first; he was shot through the
arm. All of a sudden they heard, without
knowing where the news came from, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
gates had been burst open, and every one
rushed thither. Wolf was shot through the
body, and died two days after, telling me that
if he had a thousand lives he would be glad to
sacrifice them all in my service. A sergeant
and five sappers who burst open the gates
were killed on the spot, and twenty-five men
were wounded.</p>

<p>“Nothing has ever grieved me so much
as seeing these fine, excellent fellows,
stretched side by side with their lieutenant
uttering these touching things. Formerly
when I sacrificed the lives of my men,
sometimes needlessly, we shared the same
dangers, and it had not the same effect
on me. But I had sent these poor fellows
forward, and unable to be everywhere at
once, thinking moreover to be of more use
where I was, I remained behind, and perceived
that it is often a hard thing to be a general
officer, as one is obliged to expose one’s men
to dangers which one cannot share.”</p>

<p>Prince Charles was so struck with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
confidence and devotion his father inspired
in his men, and with the praises bestowed on
him by Lieutenant Wolf on his deathbed,
that he remembered it all his life, as we shall
see later on. A few days after Marshal
Laudon<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> came to the Prince, and ordered him
to advance all his troops, and dislodge the
Hühnerwasser huzzars.</p>

<p>“We had scarcely got to Jezoway when
the rattle of the carbines was heard; the
Marshal in consequence began to get excited,
and I saw, on a reduced scale, the conqueror
of Frankfort and of Landshut; it was the
first and last time he smiled through the
whole of the campaign.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>
<p>“Charles is so brave that it is a pleasure to
see him. I was galloping by his side, and
holding his hand, saying as formerly: ‘It
would be a joke if we were struck by the
same shot!’ After that, he carried an order
to retreat to an officer, who was wounded on
receiving it. Charles was delighted at having
exchanged pistol shots with the enemy. M.
de Laudon and I were also under fire; the
first time he sees the enemy after a long
period of peace he gets as excited as if he
were still a mere lieutenant of Lycanians, and
went himself to order Klégawiez and Pallackzi
to retire from their positions, which
had been turned.</p>

<p>“I said to him: ‘Marshal, let us rather
send our orderly officers and our aides-de-camp.’
When I looked round there were
none left; they had all gone off like giddy
fellows with Charles. Pösig was taken at
about twelve o’clock.</p>

<p>“Such is the simple story of a very pretty
and amusing little affair—similar, however, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
many others that our generals make a fuss
about, and the newspapers describe as serious
battles, for the edification of the coffee-rooms
and society of the capital.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Marie-Thérèse, in her ceaseless
efforts to bring the war to a close, won
over the Czarina to her cause, and at length
succeeded in spite of the Emperor Joseph,
who was ignorant of his mother’s negotiations.</p>

<p>A Congress met at Teschen on the
10th of April 1779, and peace was signed
on the 13th of May 1779. This war was
peculiar in many respects. The Palatine
dynasty, in whose interest the war had been
undertaken, took no part in it. Bavaria, the
subject of dispute, was not involved in the
hostilities; and the Elector-Palatine, who had
refused the King of Prussia’s assistance, owed
the chief advantages of the peace to his
influence. The termination of this war
without a single battle left everybody in a
bad humour, especially the Prince de Ligne:
“I was not the only one displeased,” he says;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
“the Empress was dissatisfied because peace
had not been made soon enough; the
Emperor because it was concluded without
his knowledge; Marshal Lascy because his
plans had been interrupted, which, if they had
been carried out, would have proved far more
advantageous; Marshal Laudon because he
had only played the part of observer and
observed; the King of Prussia because he
had spent twenty-five millions of écus<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and
twenty-five thousand men, and had not once
done what he intended; Prince Henry because
he had been constantly crossed by the
King.”</p>

his brilliant services the Emperor Joseph made him, in 1769,
Commander-General of Moravia, and Field-Marshal in 1778. The
Empress Catherine used to say: “I cannot see Admiral
Tchitchakoff without thinking of a saying of the Prince de Ligne

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
